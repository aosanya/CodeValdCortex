# Leak Detection Scenario# INFRA-009: Leak Detection Scenario



This scenario demonstrates the multi-agent leak detection workflow in the UC-INFRA-001 Water Distribution Network.## Overview



## WorkflowThis scenario demonstrates the CodeValdCortex framework's multi-agent coordination capabilities through a realistic water distribution network leak detection and isolation workflow.



1. **Sensor detects anomaly**: Pressure sensor detects significant pressure drop## Scenario Flow

2. **Publishes alert**: Alert published to `zone.central.leak.detected` topic

3. **Pipe analyzes**: Pipe agent analyzes the situation and confirms leak### Step 1: Sensor Detects Anomaly

4. **Valve isolation**: Zone coordinator orders upstream/downstream valves to close**Agent**: `SENSOR-001` (Pressure Sensor North Main)

5. **Escalation**: Incident escalated to control room for maintenance dispatch- Detects pressure drop from expected 6.0 bar to 4.5 bar (-25% deviation)

- **Publishes** alert to pub/sub topic: `zone.north.leak.detected`

## Usage- **Sends** direct message to `PIPE-001` for immediate notification



```bash### Step 2: Pipe Agent Analyzes Alert

# Ensure CodeValdCortex framework is running with agent instances**Agent**: `PIPE-001` (North Main Pipe)

cd /workspaces/CodeValdCortex/usecases/UC-INFRA-001-water-distribution-network- Receives sensor notification

./start.sh- Analyzes pressure/flow correlation

- Confirms leak probability: 85%, estimated loss: 50 L/min

# In another terminal, run the scenario- **Publishes** confirmation to topic: `zone.north.leak.confirmed`

cd scenarios/leak_detection- **Sends** CLOSE commands to isolation valves:

go run main.go  - `VALVE-001` (upstream)

```  - `VALVE-002` (downstream)



## Expected Output### Step 3: Valve Agents Isolate Section

**Agents**: `VALVE-001`, `VALVE-002`

The scenario will demonstrate:- Receive CLOSE commands from pipe agent

- âœ… Agent discovery and validation- Execute valve closure (30-second transition)

- ðŸ“Š Pressure anomaly detection (2.1 PSI vs 4.0 PSI threshold)  - Update position from 100% open to 0% (fully closed)

- ðŸ”§ Pipe analysis with 87% confidence- **Publish** status updates to topic: `zone.north.valve.status`

- ðŸšª Valve isolation commands

- ðŸš¨ Control room escalation### Step 4: Zone Coordinator Escalates

- ðŸ“ˆ Performance metrics (6 messages, 10-second response time)**Agent**: `COORDINATOR-001` (North Zone Coordinator)

- Aggregates incident data from all agents

## Dependencies- Creates escalation report with:

  - Leak probability, estimated loss

- CodeValdCortex framework running on localhost:8083  - Affected pipe and sensors

- Agent instances created (sensor, pipe, valve, zone_coordinator types)  - Isolation status

- ArangoDB for message persistence  - Maintenance requirements

- **Publishes** escalation to topic: `control.room.escalation`

## Messages Sent- Triggers maintenance crew dispatch



1. **Pub/Sub**: `zone.central.leak.detected` (pressure anomaly)## Agent Communication Patterns

2. **Direct**: Pipe â†’ Zone Coordinator (analysis)

3. **Direct**: Zone Coordinator â†’ Upstream Valve (close command)### Direct Messaging (Point-to-Point)

4. **Direct**: Zone Coordinator â†’ Downstream Valve (close command)- Sensor â†’ Pipe: Anomaly notification

5. **Pub/Sub**: `control_room.incidents.high_priority` (escalation)- Pipe â†’ Valves: Close commands

### Publish/Subscribe (Broadcast)
- Sensor publishes: `zone.north.leak.detected`
- Pipe publishes: `zone.north.leak.confirmed`
- Valves publish: `zone.north.valve.status`
- Coordinator publishes: `control.room.escalation`

### Message Metadata
- **Priority levels**: 1-10 (8-10 for critical alerts/commands)
- **TTL**: 60s for commands, 1-2 hours for alerts
- **Correlation IDs**: Link related messages across agents
- **Custom metadata**: Zone, severity, action required

## Prerequisites

1. **ArangoDB** running and accessible
2. **Agent instances** created in database:
   - `SENSOR-001`: Pressure sensor
   - `PIPE-001`: Pipe agent
   - `VALVE-001`, `VALVE-002`: Valve agents
   - `COORDINATOR-001`: Zone coordinator

3. **Environment** configured in `.env` file (parent directory)

## Running the Scenario

### Option 1: Direct Execution
```bash
cd /workspaces/CodeValdCortex/usecases/UC-INFRA-001-water-distribution-network/scenarios/leak_detection
go run main.go
```

### Option 2: Build and Run
```bash
cd /workspaces/CodeValdCortex/usecases/UC-INFRA-001-water-distribution-network/scenarios/leak_detection
go build -o leak_detection main.go

### 1. Messages (`agent_messages`)
```javascript
// Query for messages sent during scenario
FOR msg IN agent_messages
  FILTER msg.created_at >= "2025-10-23T00:00:00Z"
  SORT msg.created_at DESC
  RETURN {
    from: msg.from_agent_id,
    to: msg.to_agent_id,
    type: msg.message_type,
    priority: msg.priority,
    status: msg.status
  }
```

```javascript
// Query for publications
FOR pub IN agent_publications
  FILTER pub.published_at >= "2025-10-23T00:00:00Z"
  SORT pub.published_at DESC
  RETURN {
    publisher: pub.publisher_agent_id,
    event: pub.event_name,
    type: pub.publication_type,
    metadata: pub.metadata
  }
```
