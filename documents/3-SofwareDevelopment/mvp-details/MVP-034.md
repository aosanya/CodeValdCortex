### MVP-034: Run Execution FSM

Objective: Implement run/task execution finite state machine with 9 states, retry/backoff logic, waiting states, and orphan recovery.

Key Deliverables:

1. Run states (Pending, Running, Waiting I/O, Waiting HITL, Succeeded, Failed, Compensating, Compensated, Orphaned)
2. RetryPolicy and backoff strategies
3. Wait conditions handling (I/O, HITL, dependency, rate-limit)
4. Orphan detection and recovery mechanisms
5. Compensation/Saga support and APIs

Acceptance Criteria:
- All 9 run states implemented
- Retry policy with exponential backoff works
- Wait states handle timeouts correctly
- Orphan detection and recovery functional
- Compensation steps execute in order
- Run history and metrics collected

Dependencies: MVP-033 (Agent Lifecycle FSM)
