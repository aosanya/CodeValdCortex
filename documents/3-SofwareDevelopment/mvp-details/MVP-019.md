# MVP-019: Performance Optimization & Scale

**Status**: Not Started  
**Priority**: P1  
**Estimated Effort**: Medium  
**Dependencies**: MVP-018

---

## Objective

Ensure the broadcasting system can handle production-scale loads with low latency and high reliability.

---

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Caching Strategy
- Cache subscriber lists in memory with TTL
- Cache broadcast configurations
- Cache geofence definitions
- Redis integration for distributed caching

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- Batch property updates where possible
- Async message publishing
- Connection pooling for message broker
- Efficient subscriber filtering at source

### 3. Load Balancing
- Distribute agents across broadcaster instances
- Sharding strategy for high-volume agents
- Health checks and failover

### 4. Monitoring & Alerting
- Prometheus metrics integration
- Grafana dashboards for broadcast metrics
- Alert rules for anomalies (high latency, failures)
- Performance profiling tools

### 5. Resource Limits
- Implement `BroadcastResourceLimits`
- Rate limiting per agent
- Throttling for misbehaving agents
- Circuit breakers for external services

## Performance Targets

- **Broadcast-to-delivery latency**: <500ms (p99)
- **Concurrent agents**: 10,000+
- **Subscribers per agent**: 1,000+
- **Message throughput**: 100,000/min
- **System uptime**: 99.9%

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Support 10,000+ concurrent broadcasting agents
- [ ] Sub-second delivery latency (p99 < 500ms)
- [ ] Handle 100,000+ messages per minute
- [ ] Memory usage stays within bounds under load
- [ ] Passes load and stress tests
