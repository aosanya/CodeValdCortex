### MVP-031: Work Items Lifecycle & SLA

Objective: Implement complete lifecycle state machine, timers, breach handlers, and SLA/SLO enforcement for work items.

Key Deliverables:

1. State machine with states: Planned, In-Progress, Waiting, Review, Done, Failed, Rolled-back
2. SLA/SLO fields and enforcement (WorkItemSLA model)
3. Timer service for SLA monitoring and breach detection
4. Breach actions (auto-escalate, auto-retry, remediation creation, notify stakeholders)
5. API endpoints for transitions, state-history and SLA breaches

Acceptance Criteria:
- State machine enforces valid transitions
- SLA timers track response and completion times
- Breach detection triggers configured actions
- Escalation policies execute correctly
- State history is complete and queryable
- Metrics collected for SLA compliance

Dependencies: MVP-030 (Work Items Core Schema & Registry)
