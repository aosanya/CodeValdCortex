### MVP-033: Agent Lifecycle FSM

Objective: Implement comprehensive agent lifecycle finite state machine with 10 states, transitions, guards, timeouts, and health probes.

Key Deliverables:

1. Agent lifecycle states (Registered, Scheduled, Starting, Healthy, Degraded, Backoff, Draining, Quarantined, Stopped, Retired)
2. Health probe models (liveness, readiness, http/tcp/exec/grpc)
3. Heartbeat and timeout monitoring
4. Transition guards and validation
5. API endpoints for state, transitions, state-history and health

Acceptance Criteria:
- All 10 lifecycle states implemented
- State transitions follow FSM rules
- Health probes work for all probe types
- Timeouts trigger appropriate actions
- Heartbeat monitoring detects failures
- Guards prevent invalid transitions

Dependencies: MVP-032 (Work Items Assignment & Routing)
