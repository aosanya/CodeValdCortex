3. Tenant migration tools (export/import, zero-downtime migration)
4. Compliance dashboards and audit trails
5. API endpoints for tenant export/import/migrate and compliance reports

Acceptance Criteria:
- Dedicated nodes isolate tenant workloads
- Data residency rules enforced
- Tenant migration completes successfully
- Compliance dashboards show status
- Audit trails complete and queryable
- Encryption at rest functional
