# MVP-016: Core Broadcasting Infrastructure

**Status**: Not Started  
**Priority**: P1  
**Estimated Effort**: High  
**Dependencies**: MVP-013

---

## Objective

Build the foundational broadcasting system that enables agents to automatically publish properties at configurable intervals.

---

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Data Structures
- `BroadcastConfiguration` type with rules, intervals, privacy controls
- `BroadcastRule` with condition evaluation logic
- `PropertyUpdateMessage` format
- `BroadcastMetrics` for monitoring

### 2. Core Services
- `PropertyBroadcaster` service implementing lifecycle management
- `ContextEvaluator` for rule matching and interval determination
- `BroadcastConfigRepository` for persistent storage

### 3. Agent Integration
- Extend Agent base class with broadcasting methods
- Add `EnableBroadcasting()`, `StartBroadcasting()`, `StopBroadcasting()`
- Add `UpdateBroadcastInterval()`, `PauseBroadcasting()`, `BroadcastNow()`
- Implement property collection from agent state

### 4. PubSub Integration
- Extend PubSubService with `PublishPropertyUpdate()`
- Add topic routing for property updates
- Implement message formatting and priority handling

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Agent can configure and start broadcasting
- [ ] Context-aware interval adjustment works correctly
- [ ] Properties are published to message bus
- [ ] Basic metrics collection functional
- [ ] Unit tests for all core components (>80% coverage)
