# MVP-018: Privacy & Security Controls

**Status**: Not Started  
**Priority**: P1  
**Estimated Effort**: Medium  
**Dependencies**: MVP-017

---

## Objective

Implement comprehensive privacy and security features to protect sensitive location and property data.

---

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Geofencing Service
- Geofence zone definition and storage
- Point-in-polygon detection
- Integration with broadcast pause logic
- Admin UI for geofence management

### 2. Property Masking
- Masking rule configuration per property
- Context-aware masking (e.g., mask exact location, show only vicinity)
- Redaction of sensitive fields

### 3. Permission Model
- `BroadcastPermissions` service
- Subscriber authorization checks
- Property-level access control
- Approval workflow for sensitive publishers

### 4. Audit Logging
- Log all subscription requests
- Track property access patterns
- Record broadcast pause/resume events
- Generate compliance reports

### 5. Encryption
- Encrypt sensitive properties in transit
- Secure storage of subscriber credentials
- API authentication and authorization
