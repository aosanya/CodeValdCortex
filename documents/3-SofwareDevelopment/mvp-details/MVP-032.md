### MVP-032: Work Items Assignment & Routing

Objective: Build declarative routing rules engine with skill matching, cost optimization, and agent selection algorithms.

Key Deliverables:

1. Routing rules engine data model and evaluator
2. Agent selection algorithms (skills-based, cost optimization, load balancing)
3. Skill matching components and weights
4. Assignment service with fallback and retry logic
5. API endpoints for assignment and routing rules management

Acceptance Criteria:
- Routing rules evaluate correctly
- Skills matching finds qualified agents
- Cost budgets are respected
- Data residency rules enforced
- Load balancing works across agents
- Fallback mechanisms handle no-match scenarios

Dependencies: MVP-031 (Work Items Lifecycle & SLA)
