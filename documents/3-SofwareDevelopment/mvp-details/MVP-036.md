### MVP-036: Quarantine System

Objective: Implement comprehensive quarantine system with triggers, evidence capture, triage workflow, and re-enablement process.

Key Deliverables:

1. Quarantine triggers (security, policy, anomaly, resource abuse, repeated failures)
2. Evidence capture model and storage
3. Automated triage workflow and assignment
4. Re-enablement process with checklist and approvals
5. SLA tracking and escalation

Acceptance Criteria:
- Quarantine triggers isolate agents correctly
- Evidence capture includes required data
- Triage workflow assigns and tracks investigations
- Re-enablement requires all approvals
- SLA tracking monitors response times
- Post-mortem documentation generated

Dependencies: MVP-035 (Health & Circuit Breakers)
