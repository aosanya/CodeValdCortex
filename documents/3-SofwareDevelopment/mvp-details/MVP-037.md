### MVP-037: Deployment Rollouts

Objective: Implement multiple deployment strategies (blue-green, canary, progressive delivery) with SLO-based automatic rollback.

Key Deliverables:

1. Blue-Green deployment support
2. Canary stages and progressive delivery model
3. SLO-based rollback triggers and error budget integration
4. Deployment metrics and API endpoints
5. Integration with monitoring and metrics to automate rollouts

Acceptance Criteria:
- Blue-green deployments switch instantly
- Canary stages progress automatically
- Progressive delivery increments correctly
- Rollback triggers fire on threshold breach
- Error budget tracking prevents issues
- All deployment types support instant rollback

Dependencies: MVP-036 (Quarantine System)
