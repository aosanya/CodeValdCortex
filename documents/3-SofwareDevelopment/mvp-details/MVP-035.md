### MVP-035: Health & Circuit Breakers

Objective: Implement health probe framework for multiple probe types and circuit breaker integration for external dependencies.

Key Deliverables:

1. Health probe framework (HTTP, TCP, Exec, gRPC)
2. Circuit breaker service with states (closed, open, half_open)
3. Degradation detection and recovery
4. Integration points (DB, external APIs, queues, caches)
5. Monitoring dashboard for circuit status and probe results

Acceptance Criteria:
- All 4 probe types functional
- Circuit breaker opens on threshold breach
- Half-open state tests recovery
- Degradation detection works correctly
- Agent transitions to Degraded when circuit opens
- Monitoring dashboard displays status

Dependencies: MVP-034 (Run Execution FSM)
