## Architecture Overview

CodeValdCortex is built as an enterprise-grade multi-agent AI orchestration platform with the following key components:

### 1. Agent Management Layer
- **Agent Lifecycle Manager**: Handles agent creation, deployment, and termination
- **Resource Scheduler**: Optimizes resource allocation across agent pools
- **Health Monitor**: Provides comprehensive health checking and recovery
- **Registry Service**: Centralized agent discovery and metadata management

### 2. Orchestration Engine
- **Workflow Engine**: DAG-based workflow execution with parallel task processing
- **Message Broker**: High-performance Go channel-based communication
- **State Manager**: Distributed state synchronization using ArangoDB
- **Resource Optimizer**: Intelligent resource allocation and scaling

### 3. Infrastructure Layer
- **Kubernetes Platform**: Container orchestration with auto-scaling
- **ArangoDB Cluster**: Multi-model database for agent state and workflows
- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger integration
- **Security Framework**: RBAC, SSO integration, and network policies

### 4. Enterprise Integration
- **Authentication Service**: Multi-provider SSO with fine-grained RBAC
- **Observability Platform**: Comprehensive metrics, logging, and tracing
- **API Gateway**: REST and gRPC APIs with authentication and rate limiting
- **Audit System**: Complete audit trail for compliance and security

## Technology Stack

### Core Platform
- **Language**: Go 1.21+ (leveraging native concurrency with goroutines and channels)
- **Container Platform**: Kubernetes 1.28+ with Helm chart deployment
- **Database**: ArangoDB 3.11+ (multi-model: document, graph, key-value)
- **Messaging**: Go channels with persistent message queues

### Monitoring and Observability
- **Metrics**: Prometheus with custom CodeValdCortex metrics
- **Visualization**: Grafana with pre-built dashboards
- **Tracing**: Jaeger for distributed tracing
- **Logging**: Structured logging with correlation IDs

### Development Tools
- **Build System**: Make with automated tasks
- **Testing**: Go testing with testcontainers for integration tests
- **Code Quality**: golangci-lint with comprehensive rules
- **Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- kubectl and Helm (for Kubernetes deployment)
- Git

### Quick Start
1. **Clone Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/pweza/core.git`
2. **Setup Development Environment**: `make dev-start`
3. **Build Application**: `make build`
4. **Run Tests**: `make test`
5. **Access Services**:
   - ArangoDB: http://localhost:8529 (root/devpassword)
   - Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
   - Grafana: http://localhost:3000 (admin/devpassword)
   - Jaeger: http://localhost:16686

### Development Workflow
1. **Feature Development**: Create feature branch, implement with tests
2. **Quality Checks**: Run `make lint` and `make test`
3. **Local Testing**: Use `make dev-start` for integration testing
4. **Code Review**: Submit PR with comprehensive test coverage
5. **Deployment**: Automated CI/CD pipeline handles deployment

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- **Agent Creation**: <5 seconds for standard agent creation
- **Message Latency**: <100ms for agent-to-agent communication
- **Workflow Execution**: Support for 10,000+ concurrent agents
- **API Response Time**: <200ms for 95th percentile
- **System Throughput**: 100,000+ messages per second

### Reliability Targets
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability with automatic recovery
- **Data Consistency**: ACID compliance with optimistic concurrency control
- **Fault Tolerance**: Automatic failover with <30 seconds recovery time
- **Backup Recovery**: <4 hours for complete system restoration

### Enterprise Requirements
- **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities in production
- **Compliance**: Complete audit trail with RBAC enforcement
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling across multiple clusters
- **Observability**: Real-time monitoring with proactive alerting
