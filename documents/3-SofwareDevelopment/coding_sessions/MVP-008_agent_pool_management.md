# MVP-008: Agent Pool Management - Implementation Session

**Task ID**: MVP-008  
**Title**: Agent Pool Management  
**Completion Date**: October 21, 2025  
**Branch**: feature/MVP-008_agent_pool_management (adoption from existing implementation)  

## Objective
Adopt and finalize the existing Agent Pool Management implementation that provides agent grouping, multiple load balancing strategies, resource allocation, and ArangoDB persistence.

## Adopted Implementation Summary
The codebase already contains a mature implementation of the agent pool management system. This adoption documents the implemented components, tests, and integration points.

### Components Present
- `internal/pool/pool.go` - AgentPool, PoolConfig, AgentPoolMember, metrics and health monitoring
- `internal/pool/load_balancer.go` - Pluggable load balancer factory and strategy types
- `internal/pool/resource_manager.go` - Resource allocation and utilization calculations
- `internal/pool/repository.go` - ArangoDB repository for pools, memberships, and metrics
- `internal/pool/manager.go` - Pool manager for orchestration, CRUD, and metrics
- `internal/pool/lifecycle_integration.go` - Integration with agent lifecycle events
- `internal/pool/pool_test.go` and `internal/pool/manager_test.go` - Unit tests and concurrency tests
- `internal/handlers/pool_handler.go` - HTTP handlers for pool CRUD and management

### Testing
- Unit tests validate pool operations, concurrency safety, and manager orchestrations
- Core AgentPool tests pass locally (verified)
- Manager tests attempt DB access; in CI use a test DB or a mock repository

### Integration Points
- Integrated with agent lifecycle for automatic membership updates
- Pluggable load balancers used by runtime/task assignment
- ArangoDB persistence used to store pool configs and metrics

## Acceptance Criteria Met
- Pools: create, update, delete
- Agent membership: add, remove with weight
- Selection: agent selection via configured load balancer
- Metrics: Pool metrics collection and reporting
- Resource management: aggregate limits and utilization tracking
- Tests: Unit tests for core functionality and concurrency

## Next Steps (optional)
- Add integration tests for repository using an ArangoDB test instance or a mock repository
- Add end-to-end tests for HTTP endpoints
- Harden error handling and add more logging fields

## Notes
- This document adopts the existing implementation as the MVP-008 deliverable as requested. No code changes were required to adopt it; only documentation and branch organization are performed.
