### MVP-021: Agency Management System

**Objective**: Build the backend infrastructure for managing agencies (use cases) as first-class entities in the system, with database persistence and full CRUD operations.

**Key Deliverables**:

1. **Database Schema (ArangoDB)**:
   - `agencies` collection with fields:
     ```json
     {
       "_key": "UC-INFRA-001",
       "id": "UC-INFRA-001",
       "name": "Water Distribution Network",
       "display_name": "ðŸ’§ Water Distribution",
       "description": "Smart water infrastructure monitoring and management",
       "category": "infrastructure",
       "icon": "ðŸ’§",
       "status": "active",
       "config_path": "/usecases/UC-INFRA-001-water-distribution-network",
       "env_file": ".env",
       "metadata": {
         "location": "Nairobi, Kenya",
         "agent_types": ["pipe", "sensor", "pump", "valve", "coordinator"],
         "total_agents": 293,
         "zones": 5,
         "api_endpoint": "/api/v1/agencies/UC-INFRA-001"
       },

         "auto_start": true,
         "monitoring_enabled": true,
         "dashboard_enabled": true,
         "visualizer_enabled": true
       },
       "created_at": "2025-10-20T10:00:00Z",
       "updated_at": "2025-10-25T14:30:00Z",
       "created_by": "system"
     }
     ```
   - Indexes on `id`, `category`, `status` for efficient queries
   - Unique constraint on `id` field

2. **Backend Services**:
   - `AgencyService` interface:
     ```go
     type AgencyService interface {
         CreateAgency(agency *Agency) error
         GetAgency(id string) (*Agency, error)
         ListAgencies(filters AgencyFilters) ([]*Agency, error)
         UpdateAgency(id string, updates AgencyUpdates) error
         DeleteAgency(id string) error
         SetActiveAgency(id string) error
         GetActiveAgency() (*Agency, error)
     }
     ```
   - `AgencyRepository` for ArangoDB operations
   - Configuration loader for agency-specific .env files
   - Validation service for agency configurations

3. **REST API Endpoints**:
   ```

## Risk Assessment

### Identified Risks
- **Technical Debt**: Rushing MVP features may compromise code quality
- **Scope Creep**: Adding non-essential features that delay launch
- **Performance Issues**: Scalability problems under load
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Inadequate security implementation
- **Integration Challenges**: Third-party service dependencies

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Code Reviews**: Mandatory peer review for all code changes
- **Feature Freeze**: Strict adherence to MVP scope definition
- **Load Testing**: Early performance testing with realistic data volumes
- **Security Audits**: Regular security reviews and penetration testing
- **Fallback Plans**: Alternative solutions for critical third-party dependencies

### Contingency Plans
- **MVP Scope Reduction**: Remove P2/P3 features if timeline is at risk
- **Technical Alternatives**: Backup technology choices for critical components
- **Extended Timeline**: Buffer time for unexpected complications
- **Resource Scaling**: Option to add temporary team members if needed

## MVP Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Uptime**: 99%+ availability during business hours
- **Response Time**: <2 seconds for critical user actions
- **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities at launch
- **Performance**: Support for 100+ concurrent users

### User Metrics
- **Registration**: >80% completion rate for sign-up flow
- **Workflow Completion**: >70% completion rate for primary user journey
- **User Retention**: >50% of users return within first week
- **Error Rate**: <5% user-facing errors

### Business Metrics
- **Timeline**: Launch within planned development window
- **Budget**: Stay within allocated development resources
- **Value Validation**: Demonstrate core value proposition to target users
- **Market Readiness**: Receive positive feedback from beta users

## Workflow Integration

### Task Management Process
1. **Task Assignment**: Pick tasks based on priority (P0 first) and dependencies
2. **Implementation**: Update "Status" column as work progresses (Not Started â†’ In Progress â†’ Testing â†’ Complete)
3. **Completion Process** (MANDATORY):
   - Create detailed coding session document in `coding_sessions/` using format: `{TaskID}_{description}.md`
   - Add completed task to summary table in `mvp_done.md` with completion date
   - Remove completed task from this active `mvp.md` file
   - Update any dependent task references
   - Merge feature branch to main:
     ```bash
     # Merge when complete and tested
     git checkout main
     git merge feature/MVP-XXX_description
     git branch -d feature/MVP-XXX_description
     git push origin main
     ```
4. **Dependencies**: Ensure prerequisite tasks are completed before starting dependent work

### Branch Management (MANDATORY)
For each new task:
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/MVP-XXX_description

# Work on task implementation
# ... development work ...

# Build validation before merge
# - Follow coding standards
# - Run linting and validation tools
# - Verify code follows established patterns
# - Check for deprecated API usage
# - Remove unused code/imports/variables
# - Run build processes and tests
# - Fix any build errors or warnings

# Merge when complete and tested
git checkout main
git merge feature/MVP-XXX_description
git branch -d feature/MVP-XXX_description
```
