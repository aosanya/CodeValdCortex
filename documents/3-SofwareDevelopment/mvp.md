## Resource Requirements

### Team Members
- **Backend Developer**: API development, database design, security implementation
- **Frontend Developer**: UI/UX implementation, responsive design, user experience
- **DevOps Engineer**: Infrastructure setup, CI/CD, production deployment
- **QA Engineer**: Testing strategy, test automation, quality assurance

### Tools and Platforms
- **Development**: Git, Docker, VS Code/IDE of choice
- **Backend**: Node.js/Python/Go (TBD), REST/GraphQL APIs
- **Frontend**: React/Vue/Angular (TBD), CSS frameworks
- **Database**: PostgreSQL/MongoDB (TBD)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions/GitLab CI (TBD)
- **Monitoring**: Basic logging and health checks

### Infrastructure
- **Hosting**: Cloud provider (AWS/GCP/Azure TBD)
- **Environments**: Development, staging, production
- **CDN**: Basic content delivery for static assets
- **SSL**: Certificate management and HTTPS enforcement

## Risk Assessment

### Identified Risks
- **Technical Debt**: Rushing MVP features may compromise code quality
- **Scope Creep**: Adding non-essential features that delay launch
- **Performance Issues**: Scalability problems under load
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Inadequate security implementation
- **Integration Challenges**: Third-party service dependencies

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Code Reviews**: Mandatory peer review for all code changes
- **Feature Freeze**: Strict adherence to MVP scope definition
- **Load Testing**: Early performance testing with realistic data volumes
- **Security Audits**: Regular security reviews and penetration testing
- **Fallback Plans**: Alternative solutions for critical third-party dependencies

### Contingency Plans
- **MVP Scope Reduction**: Remove P2/P3 features if timeline is at risk
- **Technical Alternatives**: Backup technology choices for critical components
- **Extended Timeline**: Buffer time for unexpected complications
- **Resource Scaling**: Option to add temporary team members if needed

### Business Metrics
- **Timeline**: Launch within planned development window
- **Budget**: Stay within allocated development resources
- **Value Validation**: Demonstrate core value proposition to target users
- **Market Readiness**: Receive positive feedback from beta users

## Workflow Integration

### Task Management Process
1. **Task Assignment**: Pick tasks based on priority (P0 first) and dependencies
2. **Implementation**: Update "Status" column as work progresses (Not Started → In Progress → Testing → Complete)
3. **Completion Process** (MANDATORY):
   - Create detailed coding session document in `coding_sessions/` using format: `{TaskID}_{description}.md`
   - Add completed task to summary table in `mvp_done.md` with completion date
   - Remove completed task from this active `mvp.md` file
   - Update any dependent task references
   - Merge feature branch to main:
     ```bash
     # Merge when complete and tested
     git checkout main
     git merge feature/MVP-XXX_description
     git branch -d feature/MVP-XXX_description
     git push origin main
     ```
4. **Dependencies**: Ensure prerequisite tasks are completed before starting dependent work

### Branch Management (MANDATORY)
For each new task:
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/MVP-XXX_description

# Work on task implementation
# ... development work ...

# Build validation before merge
# - Follow coding standards
# - Run linting and validation tools
# - Verify code follows established patterns
# - Check for deprecated API usage
# - Remove unused code/imports/variables
# - Run build processes and tests
# - Fix any build errors or warnings

# Merge when complete and tested
git checkout main
git merge feature/MVP-XXX_description
git branch -d feature/MVP-XXX_description
```
