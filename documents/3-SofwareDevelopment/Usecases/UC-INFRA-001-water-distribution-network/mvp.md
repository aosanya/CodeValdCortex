## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Agent Complexity**: Implementing autonomous agents with complex state machines may be challenging
  - *Mitigation*: Start with simplified agent behaviors, iterate to add complexity
- **Real-Time Performance**: Meeting sub-second response time requirements for critical events
  - *Mitigation*: Use Redis pub/sub for low-latency messaging, optimize database queries
- **IoT Integration**: Connecting to diverse sensor protocols (MQTT, Modbus, OPC UA)
  - *Mitigation*: Use abstraction layer for protocol handling, test with simulated sensors first
- **State Consistency**: Maintaining agent state consistency across failures and restarts
  - *Mitigation*: Implement proper state persistence, use transaction isolation

### Implementation Risks
- **Framework Learning Curve**: Team may need time to learn CodeValdCortex patterns
  - *Mitigation*: Provide training sessions, code examples, pair programming
- **Scope Expansion**: Adding too many agent types or features beyond MVP
  - *Mitigation*: Strict adherence to phased approach, focus on 5 core agent types first
- **Time-Series Data Volume**: High-frequency sensor data may overwhelm storage
  - *Mitigation*: Implement data aggregation, compression, and retention policies early

### Showcase Risks
- **Demo Reliability**: Live demos may fail due to timing issues or bugs
  - *Mitigation*: Prepare recorded demo videos as backup, rehearse extensively
- **Performance Under Load**: System may not scale as expected during demos
  - *Mitigation*: Load test before demos, have fallback to smaller dataset

## Workflow Integration

### Task Management Process
1. **Task Assignment**: Pick tasks based on phase and priority (Phase 1 → Phase 6), following dependencies
2. **Implementation**: Update "Status" column as work progresses (Not Started → In Progress → Testing → Complete)
3. **Design Alignment**: Each task must reference corresponding sections in design documentation:
   - `/documents/2-SoftwareDesignAndArchitecture/Usecases/UC-INFRA-001-water-distribution-network/`
   - Include design references in coding session documents
4. **Completion Process** (MANDATORY):
   - Create detailed coding session document in `coding_sessions/` using format: `INFRA-{TaskID}_{description}.md`
   - Document how implementation maps to design specification
   - Include code examples demonstrating agent behaviors
   - Add completed task to summary table in `mvp_done.md` with completion date
   - Remove completed task from this active `mvp.md` file
   - Update any dependent task references
5. **Dependencies**: Ensure prerequisite tasks are completed before starting dependent work

### Branch Management (MANDATORY)
For each new task:
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/INFRA-XXX_description

# Work on task implementation
# ... development work following design specs ...

# Build validation before merge
# - Verify implementation matches design document
# - Follow CodeValdCortex agent patterns
# - Run linting and validation tools
# - Test agent state machines and behaviors
# - Verify message passing between agents
# - Run integration tests
# - Check performance against metrics

# Merge when complete and tested
git checkout main
git merge feature/INFRA-XXX_description
git branch -d feature/INFRA-XXX_description
git push origin main
```

### Design-to-Implementation Mapping
Each coding session must document:
- **Design Reference**: Which design document section(s) are being implemented
- **Agent Specification**: Agent attributes, capabilities, and state machine from design
- **Code Implementation**: How the code realizes the design
- **Behavioral Examples**: Concrete examples of agent behaviors
- **Communication Patterns**: Messages published and subscribed
- **Deviations**: Any deviations from design with justification
