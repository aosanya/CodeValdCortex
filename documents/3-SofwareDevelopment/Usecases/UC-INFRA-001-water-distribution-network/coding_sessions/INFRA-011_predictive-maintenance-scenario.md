# INFRA-011: Predictive Maintenance Scenario

**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Date**: October 23, 2025  
**Branch**: `feature/INFRA-011_predictive-maintenance-scenario`  
**Related**: INFRA-009 (Leak Detection), INFRA-010 (Pressure Optimization)

## Overview

This task implements a **predictive maintenance scenario** for the water distribution network use case. The scenario demonstrates how AI-driven monitoring can detect equipment degradation early, predict failures before they occur, and generate proactive maintenance work orders - avoiding costly emergency repairs and service disruptions.

**Key Innovation**: Unlike reactive maintenance (fix after failure) or scheduled maintenance (fixed intervals), this scenario demonstrates **condition-based predictive maintenance** where the system monitors equipment health in real-time and predicts optimal intervention timing based on degradation patterns.

## Objectives

1. ✅ Create predictive maintenance scenario demonstrating equipment degradation detection
2. ✅ Implement 4-week monitoring period showing progressive pump efficiency decline
3. ✅ Track multiple failure indicators (efficiency, vibration, temperature)
4. ✅ Generate multi-level alerts (early warning → degradation → critical)
5. ✅ Demonstrate predictive work order generation with cost-benefit analysis
6. ✅ Show proactive vs reactive maintenance benefits ($45K savings, 87.5% downtime reduction)
7. ✅ Use established communication REST API (from INFRA-009, INFRA-010)

## Scenario Description

### Agents Involved

**Pumps (3)**:
- `PUMP-001` - Reference pump (normal operation throughout)
- `PUMP-002` - Degrading pump (efficiency declines from 92.3% → 78.4%)
- `PUMP-003` - Reference pump (normal operation throughout)

**Coordinator (1)**:
- `COORD-NORTH` - North zone monitoring and work order generation

**Control Room**:
- `CONTROL-ROOM` - Receives alerts and maintenance reports

### Workflow (4-Week Monitoring Period)

#### **Week 1: Baseline Performance**
```
All pumps operating normally:
- PUMP-001: 94.5% efficiency, 0.8 mm/s vibration, 68.2°C
- PUMP-002: 92.3% efficiency, 1.2 mm/s vibration, 70.1°C (baseline)
- PUMP-003: 93.8% efficiency, 0.9 mm/s vibration, 69.5°C
↓
Coordinator: "All pumps within normal parameters"
```

#### **Week 2: Early Degradation Detection**
```
PUMP-002 shows early warning signs:
- Efficiency: 92.3% → 88.7% (3.6% drop)
- Vibration: 1.2 → 1.8 mm/s (50% increase)
- Temperature: 70.1 → 72.3°C (2.2°C increase)
↓
PUMP-002 publishes: "EARLY_DEGRADATION" alert (severity: LOW)
↓
Coordinator response: "Increase monitoring frequency, schedule inspection"
```

#### **Week 3: Performance Decline**
```
PUMP-002 degradation accelerates:
- Efficiency: 88.7% → 82.1% (10.2% total drop)
- Vibration: 1.8 → 2.5 mm/s (108% increase)
- Temperature: 72.3 → 75.8°C (5.7°C increase)
- Degradation rate: 3.3% per week
↓
PUMP-002 publishes: "PERFORMANCE_DEGRADATION" alert (severity: MEDIUM)
Root cause likely: Bearing wear or impeller damage
↓
Coordinator escalates: "URGENT: Maintenance required within 1 week"
```

#### **Week 4: Imminent Failure & Maintenance Scheduling**
```
PUMP-002 reaches critical state:
- Efficiency: 82.1% → 78.4% (13.9% total drop)
- Vibration: 2.5 → 3.2 mm/s (167% increase)
- Temperature: 75.8 → 78.5°C (8.4°C increase)
- Degradation rate: 3.7% per week
- Predicted failure: 3-7 days
↓
PUMP-002 publishes: "IMMINENT_FAILURE" alert (severity: CRITICAL)
Recommendation: Take offline immediately
↓
Coordinator generates work order: WO-2025-1023-001
- Scheduled: Tomorrow 02:00-08:00 (6 hours)
- Tasks: Bearing replacement, impeller inspection, alignment
- Parts: Bearing set, mechanical seal, impeller (if needed)
- Backup: PUMP-001 will boost capacity
- Cost savings: $45,000 (prevented catastrophic failure)
- Downtime reduction: 87.5% (6h vs 48h emergency repair)
```

### Communication Patterns

1. **Pub/Sub (Performance Metrics)**:
   - Topic: `zone.north.pump.efficiency`
   - Pumps publish weekly efficiency, vibration, temperature readings
   - Coordinator monitors system-wide performance

2. **Pub/Sub (Diagnostics)**:
   - Topic: `zone.north.pump.diagnostics`
   - Pumps publish early degradation alerts
   - Includes trend analysis and predictions

3. **Pub/Sub (Maintenance Alerts)**:
   - Topic: `zone.north.maintenance.alerts`
   - Escalating alerts: early → degradation → critical
   - Includes root cause analysis and recommendations

4. **Pub/Sub (Work Orders)**:
   - Topic: `zone.north.maintenance.workorders`
   - Coordinator publishes generated work orders
   - Includes scheduling, tasks, parts, cost-benefit analysis

5. **Direct Messaging (Coordinator Responses)**:
   - Coordinator acknowledges alerts from pumps
   - Provides action plans and monitoring adjustments

6. **Direct Messaging (Control Room Reports)**:
   - Coordinator sends escalations and final reports
   - Includes success metrics and business value

## Implementation Approach

### Architecture Decision: Time-Series Degradation Pattern

Unlike INFRA-009 (event-driven, single incident) and INFRA-010 (continuous loop, real-time optimization), INFRA-011 implements a **time-series degradation pattern** that demonstrates:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Week 1: Baseline Collection                  │
│         ↓                                       │
│   Week 2: Early Detection (2 weeks advance)    │
│         ↓                                       │
│   Week 3: Trend Confirmation (1 week advance)  │
│         ↓                                       │
│   Week 4: Intervention Scheduling              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓
    Maintenance before failure
```

This pattern showcases:
- **Trend analysis**: Not just point-in-time alerts, but pattern recognition
- **Multi-indicator correlation**: Efficiency + vibration + temperature together
- **Progressive alerting**: Escalating severity based on degradation rate
- **Proactive scheduling**: Maintenance planned during low-demand windows
- **Business value quantification**: Real cost savings and downtime metrics

## Key Insights & Lessons Learned

### 1. **Predictive vs Reactive Maintenance Value**

**Reactive Maintenance** (traditional approach):
- Wait for equipment to fail
- Emergency repairs: 48 hours downtime
- Higher repair costs: ~$50,000+ (expedited parts, overtime labor)
- Service disruption: Customers affected
- Secondary damage: Failure can damage connected equipment

**Predictive Maintenance** (this scenario):
- Detect degradation 2 weeks early
- Planned maintenance: 6 hours downtime (87.5% reduction)
- Lower costs: $5,000 + $45,000 savings = 90% cost reduction
- Zero service disruption: Backup pump covers capacity
- Prevent secondary damage: Controlled intervention

**ROI Calculation**:
```
Cost Savings = Emergency Repair Cost - Planned Maintenance Cost
             = $50,000 - $5,000
             = $45,000 per incident

Downtime Savings = 48h - 6h = 42 hours (87.5% reduction)
Service Continuity = 100% (vs potential 0% during emergency)
```

### 2. **Multi-Indicator Correlation**

Single-indicator monitoring misses early degradation:
- Efficiency alone: Could be flow rate changes
- Vibration alone: Could be external factors
- Temperature alone: Could be ambient conditions

**Combined indicators** provide high-confidence predictions:
```
Week 2: Efficiency ↓3.6% + Vibration ↑50% + Temp ↑2.2°C = Early warning
Week 3: Efficiency ↓10.2% + Vibration ↑108% + Temp ↑5.7°C = Confirmed trend
Week 4: Efficiency ↓13.9% + Vibration ↑167% + Temp ↑8.4°C = Imminent failure
```

### 3. **Progressive Alerting Strategy**

Escalating alert severity prevents alert fatigue:
- **Week 1**: No alerts (baseline)
- **Week 2**: LOW severity (early warning, increase monitoring)
- **Week 3**: MEDIUM severity (schedule maintenance)
- **Week 4**: CRITICAL severity (immediate action)

This gives operators time to:
1. Verify the issue (not a false positive)
2. Order parts (no expedited shipping needed)
3. Schedule during low-demand window (02:00-08:00)
4. Coordinate backup systems (PUMP-001 capacity boost)

### 4. **Time-Series Pattern Recognition**

Unlike event-driven scenarios (INFRA-009) or continuous optimization (INFRA-010), predictive maintenance requires **trend analysis**:

```go
// Not just: "Efficiency is 88.7%"
// But: "Efficiency was 92.3%, now 88.7%, dropping 3.6% in 1 week"

Payload: map[string]interface{}{
    "efficiency_percent": 88.7,
    "efficiency_delta":   -3.6,    // vs baseline
    "degradation_rate":   "3.6% per week",
    "predicted_failure":  "4-6 weeks if trend continues",
}
```

This enables:
- Failure prediction windows
- Maintenance scheduling optimization
- Parts procurement lead time management

### 5. **Business Value Quantification**

The scenario doesn't just detect problems - it **quantifies the value** of early detection:

```
Success Metrics:
- Early Detection: 2 weeks advance notice
- Cost Avoidance: $45,000
- Downtime Reduction: 87.5% (6h vs 48h)
- Service Continuity: 100% maintained
```

This transforms maintenance from a "necessary cost" to a "value generator" - critical for executive buy-in and investment justification.

### 6. **Reusable API Pattern Validation**

For the **third time** (INFRA-009, INFRA-010, INFRA-011), the communication API required **zero modifications**. The `publishMessage()` and `sendDirectMessage()` helper functions work identically across:
- Event-driven incident response
- Continuous optimization loops  
- Time-series predictive analytics

This validates the API design as general-purpose and extensible.

## Comparison: Three Scenario Patterns

| Aspect | INFRA-009 (Leak Detection) | INFRA-010 (Pressure Opt.) | INFRA-011 (Predictive Maint.) |
|--------|---------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Pattern** | Event-driven (reactive) | Continuous loop (proactive) | Time-series analysis (predictive) |
| **Timeline** | ~8 seconds (single incident) | ~25 seconds (3 cycles) | ~15 seconds (4 weeks simulated) |
| **Agents** | 4 (sensor, pipe, 2 valves, coord) | 7 (3 sensors, 3 pumps, coord) | 3 pumps + coordinator |
| **Trigger** | Anomaly detection | Continuous monitoring | Degradation pattern |
| **Workflow** | Linear (4 steps) | Cyclic (repeated) | Progressive (week-by-week) |
| **Messages** | 7 total | 39 total (3 cycles) | ~20 total (4 weeks) |
| **Alerts** | Single critical alert | Status updates | Multi-level escalating alerts |
| **Value Prop** | Incident response speed | Operational efficiency | Cost avoidance |
| **Real-world** | Emergency handling | Ongoing operations | Strategic planning |
| **Complexity** | Medium | High (coordination) | Medium-High (trend analysis) |
