## Session 1 - October 20, 2025
**Branch**: `feature/MVP-001_project_infrastructure_setup`
**Focus**: Project Infrastructure Setup & Environment Configuration

### Objectives
- Set up basic Go project structure
- Configure environment variables
- Implement configuration loading
- Set up basic HTTP server

### Changes Made

#### 1. Environment Configuration (.env)
- Created `.env` file with configuration variables:
  - `CVXC_SERVER_PORT=8082` - Server port configuration
  - `CVXC_DATABASE_PORT=8529` - ArangoDB port configuration
  - Database password placeholder for security

#### 2. Configuration System (`internal/config/config.go`)
- Added `godotenv` package for `.env` file loading
- Implemented environment variable overrides for:
  - Server port (`CVXC_SERVER_PORT`)
  - Database port (`CVXC_DATABASE_PORT`)
  - Database password (`CVXC_DATABASE_PASSWORD`)
- Added `strconv` import for string-to-int conversion
- Environment variables now automatically load on application startup

#### 3. Dependencies
- Added `github.com/joho/godotenv v1.5.1` for .env file support
- Updated `go.mod` and `go.sum`

#### 4. Infrastructure Files Created
- `config.yaml` - YAML configuration with defaults
- `docker-compose.yml` - Docker services setup (ArangoDB, Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, Redis)
- `docker-compose.dev.yml` - Development environment configuration
- `deployments/prometheus.yml` - Prometheus monitoring configuration

#### 5. QA & Testing
- Created Postman collection (`documents/4-QA/postman_collection.json`)
- Created Postman environment files:
  - `postman_environment_local.json`
- Created comprehensive QA README (`documents/4-QA/README.md`) with:
  - Test scenarios for health checks
  - Agent management tests
  - Workflow management tests
  - Metrics & monitoring tests

### Technical Details

**Configuration Hierarchy** (priority order):
1. Environment variables (`.env` file or shell exports)
2. YAML configuration file (`config.yaml`)
3. Default values (hardcoded in `config.go`)

**Server Configuration**:
- Host: `0.0.0.0`
- Port: `8082` (configurable via `CVXC_SERVER_PORT`)
- Read Timeout: 30s
- Write Timeout: 30s

**Database Configuration**:
- Type: ArangoDB
- Host: `localhost`
- Port: `8529` (configurable via `CVXC_DATABASE_PORT`)
- Database: `codevaldcortex`
- Username: `root`

### Testing
- ✅ Application starts successfully on port 8082
- ✅ Environment variables loaded from `.env` file
- ✅ Health endpoint (`/health`) returns healthy status
- ✅ Status endpoint (`/api/v1/status`) returns app information
- ✅ Configuration overrides working correctly

### Commands Used
```bash
# Install godotenv dependency
go get github.com/joho/godotenv

# Build and run application
make run

# Restart application (after env changes)
pkill -9 -f codevaldcortex
make run
```

### Issues Resolved
1. **Port Configuration Not Loading**: Initially, `.env` file wasn't being read. Fixed by:
   - Adding `github.com/joho/godotenv` package
   - Calling `godotenv.Load()` at the start of `config.Load()`

2. **Port Still Using Default**: Application needed restart after `.env` changes
   - Solution: Kill and restart process to reload environment

### Files Modified
```
modified:   .env (created)
modified:   go.mod
modified:   go.sum
modified:   internal/config/config.go
modified:   config.yaml (created)
modified:   docker-compose.yml (created)
modified:   docker-compose.dev.yml (created)
modified:   deployments/prometheus.yml (created)
modified:   documents/4-QA/README.md (created)
modified:   documents/4-QA/postman_collection.json (created)
modified:   documents/4-QA/postman_environment_local.json (created)
```

### Next Steps (MVP-002)
- [ ] Implement ArangoDB connection and repository layer
- [ ] Set up database migrations
- [ ] Create domain models for agents and workflows
- [ ] Implement basic CRUD operations for agents
- [ ] Add database health checks

### Notes
- The application is currently running on port 8082
- All sensitive configuration should use environment variables
- The `.env` file should be added to `.gitignore` for production
- Viper's `AutomaticEnv()` works in conjunction with explicit env var reads for robust configuration

### Time Spent
- Configuration setup: ~30 minutes
- Environment variable implementation: ~20 minutes
- Documentation and QA setup: ~25 minutes
- Testing and debugging: ~15 minutes
**Total**: ~1.5 hours
