**Use Case ID**: UC-INFRA-004  
**Use Case Name**: Telecommunications Network Agent System  
**System**: CodeValdTelco  
**Created**: October 24, 2025  
**Status**: Example/Reference Implementation

## Overview

CodeValdTelco is an example agentic system built on the CodeValdCortex framework that demonstrates how telecommunications infrastructure can be represented and managed as autonomous agents. This use case focuses on a telecommunications network where cell towers, routers, switches, fiber links, data centers, and network equipment are modeled as intelligent agents that monitor, communicate, and respond to network conditions.

**Note**: *"Mawasiliano" means "telecommunications" or "communications" in Swahili, reflecting the system's focus on communication network infrastructure.*

## System Context

### Domain
Telecommunications network infrastructure management, including mobile networks, fiber optics, data centers, and internet services

### Business Problem
Traditional telecommunications networks suffer from:
- Reactive fault management (fixing outages after customer complaints)
- Limited real-time visibility into network performance and quality
- Manual capacity planning and load balancing
- Slow incident detection and response times
- Poor coordination between network elements during failures
- Difficulty predicting equipment failures and capacity constraints
- Inefficient resource allocation and spectrum management
- Customer service degradation during peak demand
- Complex troubleshooting requiring extensive manual intervention
- Slow rollout of network optimization and configuration changes

### Proposed Solution
An agentic system where each network infrastructure element is an autonomous agent that:
- Monitors its own performance, capacity, and health metrics
- Communicates with neighboring network agents
- Detects faults, performance degradation, and capacity issues in real-time
- Coordinates responses to network events and traffic patterns
- Provides real-time data for decision-making and optimization
- Enables predictive maintenance and proactive capacity expansion
- Optimizes network performance and customer experience
- Automates configuration management and self-healing
- Balances load and traffic across network paths

(schema version 1.0.0) with MapLibre-GL rendering for geographic network 
coverage maps and Force-Directed layout for logical network topology. 
Relationships follow the canonical taxonomy using `supply` (data flow), 
`route` (network connections), `command` (control plane), `observe` 
(monitoring), and `depends_on` (redundancy/protection) edge types. See
