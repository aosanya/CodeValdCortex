# Use Case: CodeValdInfrastructure - Water Distribution Network Management

**Use Case ID**: UC-INFRA-001  
**Use Case Name**: Water Distribution Network Agent System  
**System**: CodeValdInfrastructure  
**Created**: October 22, 2025  
**Status**: Example/Reference Implementation

## Overview

CodeValdInfrastructure is an example agentic system built on the CodeValdCortex framework that demonstrates how physical infrastructure elements can be represented and managed as autonomous agents. This use case focuses on a water distribution network where pipes, sensors, hydrants, valves, pumps, and other infrastructure components are modeled as intelligent agents that monitor, communicate, and respond to network conditions.

## System Context

### Domain
Municipal water distribution infrastructure management and monitoring

### Business Problem
Traditional water distribution systems suffer from:
- Reactive maintenance (fixing problems after they occur)
- Limited real-time visibility into network status
- Inefficient resource allocation
- Delayed leak detection and response
- Poor coordination between infrastructure components
- Manual inspection requirements
- Difficulty predicting failures

### Proposed Solution
An agentic system where each infrastructure element is an autonomous agent that:
- Monitors its own state and performance
- Communicates with neighboring agents
- Detects anomalies and raises alerts
- Coordinates responses to network events
- Provides real-time data for decision-making
- Enables predictive maintenance

### Visualization Configuration

**Framework Topology Visualizer Integration**:

This use case uses the **Framework Topology Visualizer** (schema version 1.0.0) for real-time network topology visualization. The visualizer renders the water distribution network as a graph where nodes represent infrastructure agents and edges represent physical connections and logical relationships.

**Renderer**: MapLibre-GL (geographic basemap with infrastructure overlay)  
**Layout**: Geographic (lat/lon coordinates mapped to mercator projection)  
**Configuration**: `/usecases/UC-INFRA-001-water-distribution-network/viz-config.json`

**Canonical Relationship Types Used**:

| canonical_type | Source Agent | Target Agent | Description | Directional |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| `route` | Pipe | Pipe | Water flow routing between pipe segments | Yes |
| `route` | Pipe | Hydrant | Water supply to hydrant | Yes |
| `route` | Pipe | Reservoir | Water supply from reservoir | Yes |
| `observe` | Sensor | Pipe | Sensor monitoring pipe | Yes |
| `observe` | Sensor | Valve | Sensor monitoring valve | Yes |
| `observe` | Sensor | Pump | Sensor monitoring pump | Yes |
| `command` | Valve | Pipe | Valve controlling flow in pipe | Bidirectional |
| `supply` | Pump | Pipe | Pump supplying water to pipe | Yes |
| `supply` | Reservoir | Pipe | Reservoir supplying water to network | Yes |
| `depends_on` | Pipe | Pump | Pipe depends on pump for pressure | Yes |

**Edge Inference**:
- Primary: Agent `connection_rules` specify canonical relationships
- Secondary: Materialized edges from message history (valve operations, flow changes)
- Edge IDs: Deterministic SHA256 hash of (sorted node IDs + canonical_type + label)

**Real-time Updates**:
- WebSocket connection to `/api/v1/visualization/ws`
- JSON Patch (RFC 6902) diffs with sequence numbers
- Update frequency: 1-5 seconds for sensor data, immediate for alerts
- Replay window: Last 1000 patches (approximately 1 hour)

**Styling Rules**:
- Pipes: Color by condition_score, width by diameter
- Sensors: Icon by sensor_type, color by status
- Valves: Icon by valve_type, color by position
- Pumps: Icon with animation when running
- Hydrants: Special icon, highlight when in use
- Alerts: Pulsing red borders for warning/critical states

**Security**:
- Server-side RBAC enforcement
- Field-level masking for sensitive attributes (customer data)
- Expression sandbox for client-side filters
- Deny edges for unauthorized relationships
