# Use Case: Wazee Care - Community Elderly Care Coordination System

**Use Case ID**: UC-CARE-001  
**Use Case Name**: Community-Based Elderly Care Agent System  
**System**: Wazee Care  
**Created**: October 23, 2025  
**Status**: Concept/Planning

## Overview

Wazee Care is a community-based agentic system built on the CodeValdCortex framework that demonstrates how elderly care within a community can be coordinated and optimized through autonomous agents. This use case focuses on a community ecosystem where nurses, caregivers, maintenance workers, cooks, errand runners, and elderly residents are modeled as intelligent agents that coordinate healthcare visits, meal delivery, compound maintenance, and daily living support to ensure comprehensive care for elderly community members.

**Note**: *"Wazee" means "Elders" or "Elderly" in Swahili, reflecting the deep respect and care African communities traditionally give to their elders.*

## System Context

### Domain
Community elderly care, assisted living, home healthcare, community support services

### Business Problem
Traditional community elderly care systems suffer from:
- **Fragmented Care Coordination**: Multiple caregivers and service providers operate independently without coordination, leading to gaps in care or duplicated efforts
- **Scheduling Conflicts**: Nurses, cooks, cleaners, and errand runners lack visibility into each other's schedules, causing overlaps or missed visits
- **Limited Health Monitoring**: Irregular checkups and poor tracking of health trends prevent early detection of issues
- **Social Isolation**: Elderly members may go days without meaningful interaction or assistance
- **Emergency Response Delays**: No coordinated system to quickly respond when an elderly person needs urgent help
- **Resource Inefficiency**: Care providers travel inefficiently, and resources are not optimally allocated across multiple elderly residents
- **Lack of Family Visibility**: Family members have limited insight into the care their elderly relatives are receiving
- **Medication Management**: Difficulty ensuring medications are taken correctly and on time
- **Dietary Requirements**: Challenges in preparing and delivering appropriate meals considering health conditions
- **Dignity and Independence**: Over-assistance or under-assistance both compromise the dignity and independence of elderly residents

### Proposed Solution
An agentic system where each element of the community care network is an autonomous agent that:
- Coordinates healthcare checkups and monitors vital signs
- Schedules and optimizes meal preparation and delivery routes
- Manages compound cleaning, gardening, and maintenance tasks
- Coordinates errand running and shopping for groceries, medications, and supplies
- Tracks medication schedules and ensures compliance
- Monitors social interaction and prevents isolation
- Provides emergency response coordination
- Maintains family communication and updates
- Optimizes resource allocation and caregiver schedules
- Respects elderly residents' autonomy and preferences

## Conclusion

Wazee Care demonstrates how CodeValdCortex's agent-based framework can revolutionize community elderly care by coordinating multiple care providers, optimizing resources, ensuring comprehensive coverage, and maintaining the dignity and cultural values central to caring for elders. The system balances efficiency with compassion, technology with tradition, and independence with support.

By modeling each participant in the care ecosystem as an intelligent agent—from the elderly residents themselves to nurses, cooks, maintenance workers, and errand runners—the system creates a coordinated, responsive, and scalable solution that honors the African value of respecting and caring for elders while leveraging modern technology to ensure no elder is forgotten or neglected.

This use case can serve as a blueprint for community-based care systems in diverse cultural contexts, adaptable to varying resources, geographies, and social structures, always centered on the goal of helping elders live with dignity, health, and connection to their community.
