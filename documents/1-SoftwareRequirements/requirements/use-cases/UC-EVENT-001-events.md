# Use Case: CodeValdEvents - AI-Powered Event Info Desk

**Use Case ID**: UC-EVENT-001  
**Use Case Name**: Nuruyetu AI Info Desk for Live Events  
**System**: CodeValdEvents (Nuruyetu)  
**Created**: October 22, 2025  
**Status**: MVP Implementation

## Overview

CodeValdEvents (Nuruyetu) is an agentic system built on the CodeValdCortex framework that provides intelligent, real-time information services for live events. The system uses AI-powered agents to answer attendee questions, coordinate emergency responses, manage incident reporting, and optimize event operations through intelligent automation and human-AI collaboration.

**Note**: *"Nuruyetu" means "Light/Illumination" in Swahili, reflecting the system's role in illuminating information and guiding attendees.*

## System Context

### Domain
Live event management, attendee services, emergency coordination, venue operations

### Business Problem
Traditional event information desks suffer from:
- Long wait times for simple questions
- Inconsistent answers from different staff members

- No 24/7 availability for pre-event questions
- Poor emergency incident coordination
- Reactive rather than predictive problem solving
- Difficulty scaling for large events
- No real-time analytics on attendee needs
- Missed revenue opportunities from premium services
- Lack of integration between information and security systems

### Proposed Solution
An agentic system where intelligent agents provide:
- Instant AI-powered answers with source citations
- Real-time emergency coordination and incident tracking
- One-tap issue reporting with automated routing
- Multilingual support and accessibility features
- Predictive analytics for event optimization
- Seamless escalation to human staff when needed
- Premium features for enhanced attendee experience
- Integration with security and emergency services

   - AI-suggested answer drafted for staff review:
   
   Draft answer:
   "According to our Weather Policy (Section 3.2), if a match is 
   cancelled due to unsafe conditions:
   
   1. The match will be rescheduled within the event window if possible
   2. If rescheduling isn't possible, you have these options:
      a) Full refund to original payment method (3-5 business days)
      b) Credit toward future event (valid 12 months)
   
   Given your flight tomorrow, option (a) would likely be best.
   
   However, I recommend speaking with Guest Services directly at 
   the VIP Services Desk (Pavilion Level) or calling +1-555-VIP 
   for immediate assistance with your specific situation.
   
   Sources: Event Weather Policy v1.3, Refund Procedures Manual v2.0"

   **Current update**: Weather forecast shows 60% chance of 
   thunderstorms between 3-5 PM. We're monitoring closely and will 
   make a final decision by 1:00 PM today.
   
   **For your situation**: As a VIP ticket holder with a flight 
   tomorrow, I can arrange an expedited refund (processed immediately 
   if cancelled) or guaranteed seating at our next championship event 
   in your region.
   
   Please visit the VIP Services Desk (Pavilion Level) or call

    ```

### Scenario 4: One-Tap Issue Reporting & Resolution

**Trigger**: Multiple attendees report dirty toilets

**Agent Interaction Flow**:

1. **Attendee Agents** use quick action buttons
   ```
   12:15 - ATD-089: Taps "Toilet Dirty!" button
   Location: Restroom Block C (auto-captured)
   Photo: Optional (attendee adds photo of issue)
   
   12:17 - ATD-134: Taps "Toilet Dirty!" button
   Location: Restroom Block C (auto-captured)
   
   12:21 - ATD-201: Taps "Toilet Dirty!" button
   Location: Restroom Block C (auto-captured)
   Additional note: "Out of toilet paper too"
   ```

2. **Issue Reporter Agent (RPT-001)** receives reports
   ```
   Pattern detection:
   - Issue type: Facilities - Toilet cleanliness
   - Location: Restroom Block C
   - Reports: 3 within 6 minutes
   - Severity: MEDIUM (quality of experience, not emergency)
   - Pattern: Cluster suggests systemic issue, not isolated
   
   Issue aggregation:
   - Primary: Cleanliness
   - Secondary: Out of supplies (toilet paper)
   - Location confirmed: All reports from same block
   ```

3. **Issue Reporter** routes to responsible team
   ```
   Routing decision:
   - Department: Facilities & Cleaning Team
   - Assigned to: STAFF-FAC-03 (responsible for Blocks C-D)
   - Priority: MEDIUM
   - SLA: 30 minutes response time
   - Escalation: If no response in 30 min, alert supervisor
   
   Notification sent to STAFF-FAC-03:
   "🧹 FACILITIES ISSUE - Restroom Block C
   
   Issue: Toilet cleanliness + supplies needed
   Reports: 3 attendees (last 6 minutes)
   Location: Restroom Block C (see map)
   Photos: 1 attached
   Notes: 'Out of toilet paper too'
   
   SLA: 30 minutes
   
   [En Route] [Need Supplies] [Need Backup] [Resolved]"
   ```

4. **Human Staff Agent (STAFF-FAC-03)** responds
   ```
   12:23 - Staff taps "En Route" button
   Status: Issue acknowledged
   ETA: 5 minutes
   
   Automatic notifications sent to reporters:
   "Your report about Restroom Block C has been received.
   Cleaning team is on the way (ETA: 5 minutes).
   Thank you for helping us maintain the venue!
   
   We'll notify you when it's resolved."
   ```

5. **Staff arrives and assesses**
   ```
   12:28 - Staff arrives at location
   Taps "Need Supplies" button
   
   Supplies requested:
   - Toilet paper (12 rolls)
   - Paper towels (6 packs)
   - Cleaning supplies (standard kit)
   
   Supply request routed to:
   - Warehouse team: Prepare supplies
   - Runner: Deliver to Restroom Block C
   - ETA: 10 minutes
   
   Staff begins cleaning with available supplies
   ```

6. **Staff completes resolution**
   ```
   12:45 - Staff taps "Resolved" button
   
   Resolution details:
   - Toilets cleaned: ✓
   - Supplies restocked: ✓
   - Floor mopped: ✓
   - Duration: 17 minutes (within SLA)
   
   Before/after photos attached for documentation
   ```

7. **Issue Reporter** notifies attendees
   ```
   Notification sent to all 3 reporters:
   
   "✅ Restroom Block C has been cleaned and restocked!
   
   Thank you for reporting this issue. Your feedback helps 
   us maintain a great experience for everyone.
   
   The issue was resolved in 30 minutes.
   
   Was this resolution satisfactory?
   👍 Yes, thank you  |  👎 Still an issue"
   
   All 3 attendees respond: 👍 Yes, thank you
   ```

8. **Analytics Agent** tracks patterns
   ```
   Issue Analysis:
   
   Location: Restroom Block C
   Issue frequency: 3 reports in 6 minutes
   Historical data: Block C has 2.3x more issues than average
   Peak times: 12:00-14:00 (lunch period)
   
   Root cause hypothesis:
   - High traffic location (near food court)
   - Cleaning schedule may not match usage patterns
   - Supplies depleting faster than restocking schedule
   
   Recommendations:
   1. Increase cleaning frequency for Block C during peak hours
   2. Pre-stock extra supplies before lunch period
   3. Add Block C to "high priority" monitoring list
   4. Consider deploying additional portable facilities near food court
   
   Preventive actions for next event:
   - Schedule cleaning team specifically for Block C @ 11:30, 13:30, 15:30
   - Double toilet paper stock for food court restrooms
   - Install occupancy sensors to track usage patterns
   ```

9. **Issue Reporter generates heatmap**
   ```
   Facilities Issue Heatmap (12:00-13:00):
   
   Restroom Block C: 🔴🔴🔴 (3 reports - HIGH)
   Restroom Block A: 🟡 (1 report - MEDIUM)  
   Restroom Block B: 🟢 (0 reports - GOOD)
   Restroom Block D: 🟢 (0 reports - GOOD)
   
   Visual heatmap displayed on operations dashboard
   
   Predictive alert:
   "Based on current patterns, expect Block C to need attention 
   again around 14:30 (afternoon peak). Recommend proactive 
   cleaning at 14:00."
   ```

10. **Proactive prevention**
    ```
    14:00 - System generates proactive work order:
    
    "PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE - Restroom Block C
    
    Reason: Predictive analytics suggest cleaning needed
    Historical pattern: Issues every 2 hours during peak
    Last cleaned: 12:45
    Recommended action: Clean before issues reported
    
    Assigned to: STAFF-FAC-03
    Priority: PROACTIVE (not urgent, but recommended)"
    
    Staff accepts and completes proactive cleaning
    Result: ZERO toilet reports from Block C between 14:00-16:00
    
    Analytics note: "Proactive cleaning prevented estimated 2-3 complaints"
    ```
