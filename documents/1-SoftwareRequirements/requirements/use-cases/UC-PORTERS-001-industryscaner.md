# Use Case: Industry Scanner - Porter's Five Forces Analysis System

**Use Case ID**: UC-PORTERS-001  
**Use Case Name**: Industry Analysis and Competitive Intelligence Agent System  
**System**: Industry Scanner  
**Created**: October 23, 2025  
**Status**: Concept/Planning

## Overview

Industry Scanner is an agentic system built on the CodeValdCortex framework that demonstrates how industry analysis and competitive intelligence can be automated through autonomous agents applying Porter's Five Forces framework. This use case focuses on a business intelligence ecosystem where specialized agents continuously monitor, analyze, and report on the five competitive forces that shape industry structure and profitability: competitive rivalry, supplier power, buyer power, threat of substitutes, and threat of new entrants.

The system enables businesses to maintain real-time situational awareness of their competitive landscape, identify emerging threats and opportunities, and make data-driven strategic decisions based on comprehensive industry analysis.

## System Context

### Domain
Strategic management, competitive intelligence, business analysis, market research, strategic planning

### Business Problem
Traditional industry analysis systems suffer from:
- **Manual and Periodic Analysis**: Porter's Five Forces analysis done manually once or twice a year, missing dynamic market changes
- **Data Fragmentation**: Information scattered across multiple sources (news, financial reports, social media, regulatory filings, market data)
- **Analysis Inconsistency**: Different analysts interpret forces differently, leading to subjective and inconsistent assessments
- **Delayed Intelligence**: Weeks or months to compile comprehensive industry reports, by which time information is outdated
- **Limited Monitoring Scope**: Impossible to manually track all competitors, suppliers, buyers, substitutes, and potential entrants simultaneously
- **Reactive Strategy**: Businesses respond to threats after they materialize rather than anticipating them
- **Siloed Insights**: Each force analyzed in isolation without understanding interdependencies and combined effects
- **Resource Intensive**: Significant analyst time required for data collection, validation, and synthesis
- **Lack of Continuous Updates**: No real-time alerting when significant changes occur in competitive forces
- **Poor Actionability**: Analysis reports don't translate into clear strategic recommendations

### Proposed Solution
An agentic system where each element of industry analysis is an autonomous agent that:
- Continuously monitors specific aspects of Porter's Five Forces framework
- Collects and validates data from diverse sources (news, financial markets, regulatory bodies, social media, patents)
- Applies analytical models to quantify force intensity and trends
- Detects significant changes and emerging threats in real-time
- Synthesizes cross-force insights and strategic implications
- Generates actionable intelligence reports and strategic recommendations
- Learns from historical patterns to predict future industry dynamics
- Adapts monitoring strategies based on industry-specific characteristics
