## Visualization Configuration

**Framework Topology Visualizer Integration**:

This use case uses the **Framework Topology Visualizer** (schema version 1.0.0) for real-time logistics network visualization. The visualizer renders the logistics platform as a geographic network where nodes represent agents (shippers, drivers, facilities) and edges represent routes and service relationships.

**Renderer**: MapLibre-GL (geographic basemap with logistics overlay)  
**Layout**: Geographic (real-world GPS coordinates mapped to mercator projection)  
**Configuration**: `/usecases/UC-LOG-001-smart-logistics-platform/viz-config.json`

**Canonical Relationship Types Used**:

| canonical_type | Source Agent | Target Agent | Description | Directional |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| `route` | Driver/Truck | Shipper | Pickup route from driver to shipper location | Yes |
| `route` | Driver/Truck | Facility | Delivery/transfer route to facility | Yes |
| `supply` | Driver/Truck | Shipper | Transportation service provision | Yes |
| `observe` | Platform | Driver/Truck | Platform monitoring truck GPS position | Yes |
| `command` | Platform | Driver/Truck | Platform assigning tasks to driver | Yes |
| `depends_on` | Shipper | Driver/Truck | Shipper depends on driver for delivery | Yes |
| `host` | Facility | Shipment | Facility temporarily hosts shipment | No |

**Agent Attributes for Visualization**:

All agent types should include:
- `coordinates`: GPS [latitude, longitude] for real-time positioning
- `connection_rules`: Array of canonical relationship definitions
- `visualization_metadata`: Display properties
  - Driver/Truck: Vehicle icon with direction arrow, color by status (available, en_route, delivering), animated movement along routes
  - Shipper: Pickup point icon, color by urgency
  - Facility: Warehouse/depot icon, color by capacity utilization
  - Shipment: Package icon on truck or facility

**Edge Inference**:
- Primary: Active shipment assignments create `route` edges
- Secondary: Bid history and service area matching
- Dynamic: Routes update in real-time as trucks move
- Edge IDs: Deterministic based on shipment ID + driver ID

**Real-time Updates**:
- WebSocket connection for live GPS tracking (30-second intervals)
- Shipment status changes via JSON Patch (pickup, in_transit, delivered)
- Bid activity updates (new bids, acceptances)
- Replay window: Last 5,000 patches (approximately 24 hours)

**Styling Rules**:
- Trucks: Animated movement with trail showing recent path, color by load status
- Routes: Polylines from origin to destination, color by status (planned, active, completed)
- Facilities: Heatmap by current cargo volume
- Shippers: Urgency indicators (pulse for urgent requests)
- Alerts: Red borders for delayed shipments or issues

**Security**:
- Server-side RBAC enforcement
- Shippers see only their own shipments
- Drivers see only assigned and bid-eligible shipments
- Facilities see only relevant incoming/outgoing cargo
- Platform admin has full visibility
- Expression sandbox for filters

**Reference Documentation**: `/documents/2-SoftwareDesignAndArchitecture/framework-topology-visualizer/`

## Conclusion

The Smart Logistics Platform demonstrates the power of the CodeValdCortex agent framework applied to freight and transportation logistics. By treating shippers, drivers, facilities, and the platform itself as intelligent, autonomous agents that coordinate through bidding, reconciliation, and real-time communication, the system achieves:

- **Marketplace Efficiency**: Automated bid matching connects shippers with optimal drivers in minutes
- **Price Discovery**: Competitive bidding creates fair, market-driven pricing
- **Network Optimization**: Return cargo matching and route optimization reduce waste and costs
- **Real-time Visibility**: GPS tracking and status updates provide complete shipment transparency
- **Trust and Safety**: Verified profiles, monitoring, and dispute resolution build marketplace confidence
- **Scalability**: Agent architecture supports thousands of concurrent shipments and users
- **Intelligence**: ML-powered optimization and predictive analytics improve outcomes

The integration with the Framework Topology Visualizer provides unprecedented visibility into the logistics network, enabling platform operators to monitor active shipments, identify bottlenecks, optimize driver allocation, predict demand patterns, and respond to disruptions with complete situational awareness.

This use case serves as a reference implementation for applying agentic principles to other logistics and marketplace domains such as ride-hailing, food delivery, courier services, freight forwarding, last-mile delivery, and on-demand service platforms.
