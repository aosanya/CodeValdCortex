**Framework Topology Visualizer Integration**:

This use case uses the **Framework Topology Visualizer** (schema version 1.0.0) for real-time warehouse topology visualization. The visualizer renders the warehouse layout as a graph where nodes represent infrastructure agents (robots, racks, docks) and edges represent physical connections and logical relationships.

**Renderer**: Canvas (for indoor warehouse layout with 2D floor plan)  
**Layout**: Custom grid-based layout matching physical warehouse coordinates  
**Alternative**: Force-Directed for logical relationships  
**Configuration**: `/usecases/UC-WMS-001-warehouse-management/viz-config.json`

**Canonical Relationship Types Used**:

| canonical_type | Source Agent | Target Agent | Description | Directional |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| `route` | Robot | Rack | Robot navigation path to rack | Yes |
| `route` | Robot | Dock | Robot path to loading dock | Yes |
| `host` | Rack | Item | Rack contains/hosts items | No |
| `command` | Picker | Robot | Picker assigns task to robot | Yes |
| `depends_on` | Order | Rack | Order depends on items in rack | Yes |
| `supply` | Dock | Rack | Inbound shipment supplies rack | Yes |
| `observe` | Sensor | Robot | Sensor monitors robot position | Yes |

**Agent Attributes for Visualization**:

All agent types should include:
- `coordinates`: [x, y] position in warehouse coordinate system (meters from origin)
- `connection_rules`: Array of canonical relationship definitions
- `visualization_metadata`: Display properties
  - Robot: Icon with direction arrow, color by status, animated when moving
  - Rack: Rectangle by dimensions, color by occupancy percentage
  - Dock: Special dock icon, color by status (available, loading, unloading)
  - Picker: Human icon, color by workload

**Edge Inference**:
- Primary: Agent `connection_rules` and warehouse floor plan
- Secondary: Real-time robot telemetry and task assignments
- Edge IDs: Deterministic SHA256 hash

**Real-time Updates**:
- WebSocket connection for live robot positions (10 Hz updates)
- Task state changes pushed via JSON Patch
- Inventory updates via efficient delta updates
- Replay window: Last 10,000 patches

**Styling Rules**:
- Robots: Animated movement along edges, battery level indicator
- Racks: Heatmap by inventory level (empty=blue, full=red)
- Docks: Status indicators (idle, active, blocked)
- Paths: Dynamic highlighting for active robot routes
- Alerts: Pulsing borders for collision warnings or errors

**Security**:
- Server-side RBAC enforcement
- Field-level masking for sensitive inventory data
- Real-time position data restricted by role
- Expression sandbox for custom filters
