# Use Case: CodeValdSmartCity - Smart City Infrastructure Coordination

**Use Case ID**: UC-INFRA-005  
**Use Case Name**: Smart City Infrastructure Coordination Agent System  
**System**: CodeValdSmartCity  
**Created**: October 24, 2025  
**Status**: Example/Reference Implementation

## Overview

CodeValdSmartCity is an example agentic system built on the CodeValdCortex framework that demonstrates how smart city infrastructure can be represented and managed as autonomous agents. This use case focuses on a comprehensive smart city ecosystem where traffic systems, public transportation, waste management, street lighting, environmental sensors, emergency services, and civic amenities are modeled as intelligent agents that monitor, communicate, and coordinate to optimize city operations.

**Note**: *"Jiji Mjanja" means "smart city" in Swahili, reflecting the system's focus on intelligent urban infrastructure coordination.*

## System Context

### Domain
Municipal smart city infrastructure management, coordination, and optimization across multiple urban systems

### Business Problem
Traditional city infrastructure management suffers from:
- Siloed systems operating independently without coordination
- Reactive maintenance and service delivery
- Limited real-time visibility into city-wide conditions
- Inefficient resource allocation across departments
- Poor emergency response coordination
- Traffic congestion and inefficient public transportation
- Energy waste from static street lighting and building management
- Environmental quality degradation (air, noise, waste)
- Citizen service requests handled manually with slow response
- Lack of data-driven decision making for urban planning
- Difficulty measuring and improving quality of life metrics

### Proposed Solution
An agentic system where each city infrastructure element is an autonomous agent that:
- Monitors its own state, performance, and environmental context
- Communicates with other infrastructure agents across domains
- Detects anomalies, inefficiencies, and opportunities for optimization
- Coordinates responses to city-wide events and emergencies
- Provides real-time data for decision-making and resource allocation
- Enables predictive maintenance and proactive service delivery
- Optimizes resource usage (energy, water, transportation)
- Improves citizen experience and quality of life
- Supports data-driven urban planning and policy making

**Visualization**: This use case uses the Framework Topology Visualizer 
(schema version 1.0.0) with MapLibre-GL rendering for geographic city 
infrastructure mapping and Hierarchical layout for departmental organization. 
Relationships follow the canonical taxonomy using `supply` (resource flow), 
`route` (network connections), `command` (control hierarchies), `observe` 
(monitoring), and `depends_on` (dependencies) edge types. Multi-layered 
visualization supports infrastructure type filtering (traffic, transit, 
environment, waste, lighting, parking). See visualization configuration in 
`/usecases/UC-INFRA-005-SmartCity/viz-config.json`.

## Conclusion

CodeValdSmartCity demonstrates the transformative potential of the CodeValdCortex agent framework applied to comprehensive smart city infrastructure coordination. By treating diverse urban infrastructure elements as intelligent, autonomous agents that communicate and coordinate across domains, the system achieves:

- **Coordination**: Seamless multi-domain infrastructure coordination for emergencies, events, and daily operations
- **Efficiency**: Dramatic operational cost reductions through optimization and automation
- **Sustainability**: Significant environmental improvements through data-driven management
- **Livability**: Enhanced citizen quality of life through better services and reduced congestion
- **Resilience**: Improved emergency response and adaptive capacity
- **Innovation**: Open platform enabling citizen engagement and third-party innovation
- **Scalability**: Framework supporting cities from 100,000 to 10+ million population

This use case serves as a comprehensive reference implementation for applying agentic principles to urban infrastructure, demonstrating how the CodeValdCortex framework can orchestrate complex, multi-domain systems. The smart city coordination patterns established here can be extended to:

- Regional infrastructure coordination (multiple cities)
- Campus and district management (universities, business parks)
- Industrial park optimization
- Special economic zones
- Military base and facility management

By integrating with the other infrastructure use cases (UC-INFRA-001 through UC-INFRA-004), CodeValdSmartCity creates a holistic smart city ecosystem where water, power, gas, telecommunications, and civic infrastructure work together intelligently to serve citizens and optimize urban life.
