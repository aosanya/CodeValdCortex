# Use Case Documentation Standard

## Overview

This document defines the standard structure and content requirements for use case design documentation within the CodeValdCortex project. All use cases must follow this structure to ensure consistency, completeness, and maintainability.

## Required Documents

Every use case folder **MUST** contain the following documents:

### 1. README.md
**Purpose**: Entry point and quick reference for the use case

**Required Sections**:
- Overview (system name, domain, status)
- Agent Types (list of 8 agent types)
- Key Design Principles (3-5 principles)
- Technology Stack (runtime, databases, frontend, deployment)
- Quick Reference (use case scenarios, key features)
- Performance Targets (table with metrics)
- Security & Privacy (data protection, access control)
- Integration Points (external systems list)
- Success Metrics (engagement, operational, business)
- Related Documents (links to other docs)

**Template**: See `README_TEMPLATE.md`

### 2. system-architecture.md
**Purpose**: Comprehensive system design and architecture

**Required Sections**:
- Architecture Overview
- Architecture Diagram (ASCII or image)
- Component Descriptions (each layer/tier)
- Data Flow Patterns
- Agent Deployment Model
- Scalability Design
- Resilience and Fault Tolerance
- Security Architecture
- Monitoring and Observability
- Deployment Strategy
- Technology Decisions (with rationale)
- Future Enhancements
- Related Documents (links)

**Template**: See `ARCHITECTURE_TEMPLATE.md`

### 3. agent-design.md
**Purpose**: Detailed specifications for each agent type

**Required Sections**:
- Overview (list of all agent types)
- For each agent type:
  - Agent Name and Purpose
  - Attributes (data structure)
  - Capabilities (functions/behaviors)
  - State Machine (states and transitions)
  - Example Behaviors (code or pseudocode)
  - Communication Patterns (who it talks to)
  - Performance Characteristics
- Agent Relationships Diagram
- Agent Lifecycle Management
- Related Documents (links)

**Template**: See `AGENT_DESIGN_TEMPLATE.md`

## Recommended Documents

Use cases **SHOULD** include these additional documents when applicable:

### 4. communication-patterns.md
- Message types and protocols
- Pub/sub topics
- Direct messaging patterns
- Hierarchical coordination
- Message schemas
- Error handling

### 5. data-models.md
- Database schemas (tables, collections)
- Entity relationships
- Data validation rules
- Indexing strategy
- Data lifecycle (retention, archival)
- Sample data

### 6. deployment-architecture.md
- Infrastructure diagram
- Container/pod specifications
- Scaling strategies
- Environment configurations
- CI/CD pipeline
- Rollback procedures

### 7. integration-design.md
- External system list
- Integration patterns (REST, GraphQL, webhooks)
- Authentication methods
- Data mapping/transformation
- Error handling
- Rate limiting

### 8. security-design.md
- Authentication and authorization
- Data encryption (at rest, in transit)
- Privacy considerations
- Compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- Threat model
- Security testing

## Specialized Documents

Certain use cases may require specialized documentation:

### For AI/ML Use Cases
- **rag-implementation.md** - RAG system design
- **ml-models.md** - Model selection, training, inference
- **prompt-engineering.md** - LLM prompt strategies

### For Real-Time Systems
- **real-time-processing.md** - Stream processing, latency optimization
- **event-sourcing.md** - Event store design

### For IoT/Edge Systems
- **edge-architecture.md** - Edge device specs, offline capability
- **device-management.md** - Provisioning, updates, monitoring

### For User-Facing Systems
- **ux-design.md** - User flows, wireframes
- **mobile-architecture.md** - Mobile app design
- **web-architecture.md** - Web app design

## Document Format Standards

### Markdown Style
- Use ATX-style headers (`#`, `##`, `###`)
- Use fenced code blocks with language identifiers
- Use tables for structured data
- Use bullet lists for items without priority
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps

### Code Examples
- Use Go for backend code examples
- Use TypeScript/JavaScript for frontend examples
- Include comments explaining key logic
- Show realistic examples, not hello-world

### Diagrams
- ASCII art for simple diagrams (preferred for text files)
- Mermaid for complex diagrams (if tools support)
- Images (PNG/SVG) for detailed architecture (store in `./diagrams/` subfolder)

### Links
- Use relative links to other docs in the project
- Use absolute links to external resources
- Include date accessed for time-sensitive external links

## File Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with hyphens: `system-architecture.md`
- Use descriptive names: `emergency-coordination.md` not `emerg.md`
- Use `.md` extension for all markdown files
- Use `UPPERCASE.md` for meta-documents (README.md, CHANGELOG.md)

## Version Control

- Include document version and last updated date in header
- Update "Last Updated" date on every material change
- Use semantic versioning for major architectural changes
- Document change history in git commits (no need for inline changelog)

## Review Process

Before considering a use case design "complete":

1. ✅ All required documents present
2. ✅ All required sections in each document
3. ✅ Code examples compile/run (if applicable)
4. ✅ Diagrams are clear and accurate
5. ✅ Links are valid
6. ✅ Metrics and targets are realistic
7. ✅ Security considerations addressed
8. ✅ Peer review completed
9. ✅ Technical lead approval

## Templates

Templates for required documents are provided in this directory:

- [README_TEMPLATE.md](./templates/README_TEMPLATE.md)
- [ARCHITECTURE_TEMPLATE.md](./templates/ARCHITECTURE_TEMPLATE.md)
- [AGENT_DESIGN_TEMPLATE.md](./templates/AGENT_DESIGN_TEMPLATE.md)
