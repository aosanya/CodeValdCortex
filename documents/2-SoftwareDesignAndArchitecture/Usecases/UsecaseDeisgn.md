# Use Case Design Guidelines for CodeValdCortex

**Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: October 22, 2025  
**Status**: Active Standard

## Purpose

This document provides guidelines for designing and documenting use cases within the CodeValdCortex framework. It ensures consistency across all use case implementations and facilitates knowledge transfer, review, and maintenance.

## Use Case Philosophy

CodeValdCortex use cases are designed around the **agent-oriented architecture** principle where:
- Each domain entity is represented as an autonomous agent
- Agents collaborate through message passing
- Agents maintain their own state and decision-making logic
- The system exhibits emergent behavior through agent interactions

## Use Case Development Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Requirements & Planning
1. **Domain Analysis** - Understand the problem domain thoroughly
2. **Agent Identification** - Identify 6-8 distinct agent types
3. **Scenario Definition** - Define 3-4 key interaction scenarios
4. **Success Criteria** - Define measurable success metrics

### Phase 2: Design
1. **System Architecture** - Design overall system structure
2. **Agent Specification** - Define each agent's attributes, capabilities, states
3. **Communication Design** - Define message patterns and protocols
4. **Data Modeling** - Design database schemas and data flows
5. **Integration Planning** - Identify external system integrations

### Phase 3: Documentation
1. **Create Required Documents** - README, system-architecture, agent-design
2. **Add Recommended Documents** - Based on use case complexity
3. **Review & Validation** - Peer review and technical lead approval

### Phase 4: Implementation
1. **Core Agents** - Implement basic agent types
2. **Communication** - Implement message passing and event handling
3. **Integration** - Connect external systems
4. **Testing** - Unit, integration, and scenario testing

- **monetization-strategy.md** - For revenue-generating use cases (UC-EVENT-001)

## Agent Design Guidelines

### Agent Identification

Each use case should have **6-8 agent types**. More agents = more complexity; fewer agents = less modularity.

**Good agent candidates**:
- Physical entities (pipes, sensors, vehicles)
- Logical entities (topics, campaigns, incidents)
- Human roles (members, volunteers, staff)
- System functions (moderators, analyzers, coordinators)

**Poor agent candidates**:
- Simple data structures (better as attributes)
- Transient operations (better as methods)
- Pure UI components (not domain entities)

### Agent Attributes

Define attributes with:
- **Name**: Clear, descriptive
- **Type**: Specific data type (string, int, []string, etc.)
- **Purpose**: Brief explanation
- **Example**: Sample value

```go
type PipeAgent struct {
    pipe_id         string    // Unique identifier (e.g., "PIPE-001")
    material        string    // Pipe material (PVC, steel, copper)
    diameter        int       // Pipe diameter in millimeters
    length          float64   // Pipe length in meters
    installation_date time.Time // Date installed
    location        GeoPoint  // GPS coordinates (start and end points)
    pressure_rating float64   // Maximum pressure rating (PSI)
}
```

### Agent Capabilities

List capabilities as:
- **Action verbs** (Monitor, Detect, Calculate, Report)
- **Specific behaviors** not generic functions
- **Domain-relevant** operations

```markdown
**Capabilities**:
- Monitor flow rate and pressure in real-time
- Detect pressure anomalies indicating leaks or bursts
- Calculate flow efficiency based on design parameters
- Track degradation over time using sensor data
- Communicate status with adjacent pipe segments
- Report maintenance needs to control center
- Predict remaining lifespan using ML models
```

### State Machines

Define states as:
- **Adjectives or nouns** (Active, Degraded, Maintenance)
- **Mutually exclusive** (agent in one state at a time)
- **Complete** (covers all possible conditions)
- **3-7 states** (too few = oversimplified, too many = complex)

Show transitions with triggers:
```
Operational → Degraded (performance < threshold)
Degraded → Warning (anomaly detected)
Warning → Critical (immediate attention required)
Critical → Maintenance (repair scheduled)
Maintenance → Operational (repair completed)
Any → Offline (network isolation)
```

### Example Behaviors

Use IF-THEN pseudocode or actual code:

```
IF pressure_drop > threshold AND flow_rate > 0
  THEN raise_alert("Possible leak detected")
  AND notify_adjacent_pipes()
  AND notify_control_center()
  AND increase_sensor_sampling_rate()
```

Or actual Go code:
```go
func (p *PipeAgent) MonitorPressure() {
    if p.currentPressure < p.minPressure && p.flowRate > 0 {
        alert := Alert{
            Type: "LEAK_SUSPECTED",
            Message: "Possible leak detected",
            Severity: "HIGH",
        }
        p.RaiseAlert(alert)
        p.NotifyAdjacentAgents()
        p.NotifyControlCenter()
    }
}
```

## Scenario Design Guidelines

### Scenario Selection

Each use case needs **3-4 core scenarios** that demonstrate:
1. **Primary workflow** - Main happy path
2. **Complex workflow** - Multiple agents, decision points
3. **Edge case** - Error handling, unusual conditions
4. **Integration** - External system interaction

### Scenario Documentation

For each scenario, include:

**1. Trigger**: What initiates the scenario
```
Trigger: Pipe agent detects pressure drop with normal flow
```

**2. Agent Interaction Flow**: Step-by-step sequence
```
1. Pipe Agent (PIPE-045) detects pressure anomaly
   State: Operational → Warning
   Action: Analyze pressure/flow data
   Decision: Possible leak detected

2. Pipe Agent notifies adjacent agents
   → Upstream Pipe (PIPE-044): "Pressure drop downstream"
   → Downstream Pipe (PIPE-046): "Pressure drop detected"
   → Sensor Agents: "Increase sampling"
   → Valve Agents: "Stand by for isolation"
```

**3. Outcome**: Final result and state changes

**4. Timing**: Expected duration for critical paths

**5. Metrics**: Performance measurements

## Architecture Guidelines

### System Layers

Most use cases follow a **3-4 layer architecture**:

1. **Edge/Device Layer** - IoT sensors, mobile apps, user interfaces
2. **Agent Runtime Layer** - Field gateways or application servers running agents
3. **Central Control Layer** - Cloud/data center with coordination and analytics
4. **Integration Layer** - External systems and services

### Communication Patterns

Document which patterns are used:

- **Direct Agent-to-Agent**: Low-latency, high-frequency (sensor → pipe)
- **Publish-Subscribe**: Broadcast events (alerts, notifications)
- **Hierarchical**: Local → Regional → Central (aggregation)
- **Mesh**: Peer coordination (pump-to-pump load balancing)

### Data Flow

Show data movement through the system:
```
Sensors → Infrastructure Agents → Zone Coordinators 
→ Regional Servers → Central Control → Dashboards
```

### Scalability

Address:
- **Horizontal scaling**: Add more instances
- **Vertical scaling**: Bigger machines
- **Data partitioning**: By geography, time, entity
- **Caching**: What, where, TTL
- **Performance targets**: QPS, latency, concurrent users

## Technology Stack Guidelines

### Framework Components

All use cases use **CodeValdCortex Framework**:
- Runtime Manager (agent lifecycle)
- Agent Registry (discovery and relationships)
- Task System (scheduling)
- Memory Service (state persistence)
- Communication System (messaging)
- Configuration Service (parameters)
- Health Monitor (observability)

### Database Selection

Choose based on data characteristics:

- **PostgreSQL**: Relational data, ACID transactions
- **Redis**: Caching, message broker, real-time
- **TimescaleDB**: Time-series sensor data
- **ArangoDB/Neo4j**: Graph relationships
- **Pinecone/Weaviate**: Vector embeddings for AI

### External Services

- Error rate (<1%)
- Resource utilization

### 2. Operational Metrics
- Automation rate (% handled by agents)
- Efficiency gains (time/cost savings)
- Detection/prevention rates
- Resolution times
- Resource optimization

### 3. User Experience Metrics
- Satisfaction scores (NPS, CSAT)
- Engagement rates (MAU, DAU)
- Task completion rates
- App store ratings
- Feature adoption

### 4. Business Metrics
- ROI and payback period
