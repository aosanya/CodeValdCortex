# UC-CHAR-001: Charity Distribution Network - Design Documentation

**Use Case**: CodeValdTumaini - Charity Distribution Network Agent System  
**Design Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: October 22, 2025

## Overview

This directory contains the software design and architecture documentation for the Charity Distribution Network use case (UC-CHAR-001). The system demonstrates how charitable giving, item collection, distribution, and recipient feedback can be managed through autonomous agents within the CodeValdCortex framework.

**Note**: *"Tumaini" means "Hope" in Swahili, reflecting the system's mission to bring hope through charitable giving.*

## Quick Reference

### Agent Types
1. **Donor Agent** - Individuals or organizations making donations
2. **Recipient Agent** - Individuals or families receiving assistance
3. **Item Agent** - Physical items being donated/distributed
4. **Volunteer Agent** - Volunteers facilitating distribution
5. **Logistics Coordinator Agent** - Routing and delivery coordination
6. **Storage Facility Agent** - Warehouses and distribution centers
7. **Need Matcher Agent** - AI-powered need-to-donation matching
8. **Impact Tracker Agent** - Outcome measurement and reporting

### Key Design Principles
- **Dignity**: Recipient-centered design respecting dignity and agency
- **Transparency**: Clear tracking of donations from donor to recipient
- **Efficiency**: Optimize matching and logistics to minimize waste
- **Feedback Loop**: Recipients can express gratitude and ongoing needs
- **Impact Measurement**: Track outcomes and demonstrate effectiveness

### Technology Stack
- **Runtime**: CodeValdCortex Framework (Go)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (donations, recipients), Neo4j (relationship graph)
- **Message Broker**: Redis Pub/Sub
- **Frontend**: React/React Native (donor/recipient apps)
- **Geolocation**: Google Maps API for routing and proximity
- **ML**: Need prediction, matching optimization
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes (cloud), Mobile apps

## Use Case Scenarios

### Primary Scenarios
1. **Donation with Gratitude** - Donor gives → items matched → recipient receives → expresses gratitude
2. **Urgent Need Expression** - Recipient states need → matching → notification → quick fulfillment
3. **Recipient Graduation** - Recipient improves situation → shares story → inspires others
4. **Disaster Response** - Emergency need → rapid coordination → distribution → tracking

### Secondary Scenarios
- Recurring donation subscriptions
- Volunteer shift scheduling and coordination
- Storage facility inventory management
- Impact report generation for donors
- Sponsor matching for ongoing support
