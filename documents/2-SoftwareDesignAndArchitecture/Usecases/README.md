## Common Design Principles

All use cases follow these core principles:

### 1. Agent Autonomy
- Each entity is represented as an autonomous agent
- Agents make local decisions based on their state and rules
- Agents communicate via message passing, not shared state

### 2. Scalability
- Horizontally scalable agent deployment
- Stateless where possible, persistent state when necessary
- Efficient communication patterns (pub/sub, direct messaging)

### 3. Resilience
- Graceful degradation when components fail
- Offline capability for edge deployments
- Automatic recovery and reconnection

### 4. Real-Time Performance
- Sub-second response times for critical operations
- Asynchronous processing where appropriate
- Caching and optimization strategies

### 5. Observability
- Comprehensive logging and metrics
- Health monitoring for all agents
- Alerting on anomalies and failures

- **TimescaleDB** - Time-series data (sensors, metrics)
- **ArangoDB/Neo4j** - Graph relationships (use case dependent)
- **Pinecone/Weaviate** - Vector stores for AI/RAG (UC-EVENT-001)

### AI/ML

## Contributing

When adding new design documents:

1. Follow the established structure (README → system-architecture → agent-design → etc.)
2. Include diagrams where helpful (ASCII art is fine)
3. Provide code examples in Go for implementation clarity
4. Link to related documents
5. Define success metrics and monitoring strategies
