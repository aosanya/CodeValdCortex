# UC-RIDE-001: RideLink - Smart Ride-Hailing Platform

**Use Case ID**: UC-RIDE-001  
**System Name**: RideLink (CodeValdSafari - "Journey" in Swahili)  
**Domain**: Transportation & Mobility  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Status**: Design Phase  
**Last Updated**: October 22, 2025

## Overview

RideLink is an intelligent ride-hailing platform where riders, drivers, and system agents autonomously negotiate, reconcile conflicts, and optimize ride matching using real-time location data, predictive algorithms, and multi-criteria decision-making.

The platform enables:
- **Real-Time Matching**: Sub-10-second rider-to-driver matching with intelligent agent reconciliation
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Surge pricing that automatically balances supply and demand
- **Safety-First**: Emergency SOS, trip sharing, driver verification, anomaly detection
- **Multi-Modal Options**: Economy, comfort, XL, premium rides plus ride-sharing
- **Predictive Intelligence**: Demand forecasting, heat maps, route optimization
- **Seamless Payments**: Mobile money, cards, cash with automatic processing

Unlike traditional ride-hailing platforms with centralized dispatching, RideLink leverages autonomous agents that independently evaluate opportunities and self-organize to create an efficient, fair, and responsive marketplace.

## Agent Types

The system consists of **8 autonomous agent types**:

1. **Rider Agent** - Passengers requesting rides and tracking progress
2. **Driver Agent** - Service providers offering rides and navigation
3. **Platform Agent** - Orchestrator managing matching and ride lifecycle
4. **Route Optimizer Agent** - Calculate optimal routes, monitor traffic, adjust for conditions
5. **Surge Pricing Agent** - Monitor supply/demand, calculate pricing multipliers
6. **Safety Agent** - Monitor trip anomalies, emergency response, incident management
7. **Payment Agent** - Process payments, manage refunds, handle disputes
8. **Analytics Agent** - Track KPIs, predict demand, optimize operations

Each agent operates autonomously with local decision-making while collaborating through message passing to achieve system-wide optimization.

## Key Design Principles

1. **Sub-Second Responsiveness**
   - Ride matching completed within 3-10 seconds
   - GPS updates every 5 seconds with sub-100ms processing
   - Real-time ETA updates every 30 seconds
   - Immediate emergency response (<3 seconds to alert authorities)

2. **Agent Autonomy with Fair Matching**
   - Drivers autonomously decide to accept or decline requests
   - First-to-accept wins the ride (no favoritism)
   - Platform expands search radius if no acceptance
   - Surge pricing automatically incentivizes driver availability

3. **Safety as Foundation**
   - Emergency SOS button always accessible
   - Real-time trip monitoring for anomalies
   - Automatic trusted contact notifications for night rides
   - Driver verification before each shift (facial recognition)
   - Two-way rating system protects both riders and drivers

4. **Economic Efficiency**
   - Dynamic surge pricing balances market
   - Demand heat maps guide drivers to high-demand zones
   - Ride-sharing reduces costs for budget-conscious riders
   - Scheduled rides ensure availability for planned trips

5. **Transparency and Trust**
   - Upfront fare estimates with surge indicators
   - Real-time GPS tracking visible to riders
   - Transparent rating system
   - Clear cancellation policies with fair fees

## Use Case Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Standard Ride Request (Happy Path)
**Trigger**: Rider opens app and requests RideLink Comfort from current location to destination 5 km away

**Flow**:
1. Rider sets pickup (current location) and destination (searched address)
2. System displays fare estimate: 450 KSH (no surge)
3. Rider confirms request (Ride ID: RIDE-NAI-892356)
4. Platform Agent broadcasts to 5 nearest eligible drivers (within 2 km)
5. Driver #2 accepts within 8 seconds (800m away, ETA 2 mins)
6. Rider receives driver details (name, photo, vehicle, rating 4.8★)
7. Real-time map shows driver approaching
8. Driver arrives, rider confirms and boards
9. Driver starts trip, follows navigation (12 mins, moderate traffic)
10. Driver completes trip, rider pays via M-Pesa (auto-debit)
11. Both parties rate each other (rider: 5★, driver: 5★)

**Outcome**: Trip completed on-time, smooth payment, positive experience

### Scenario 2: Surge Pricing During Peak Demand
**Trigger**: Friday evening, 6 PM, high demand in business district

**Flow**:
1. Surge Pricing Agent detects: 50 ride requests, only 15 available drivers
2. Agent calculates surge: 1.8× multiplier
3. Rider requests ride; sees surge notification: "Fares are higher due to demand"
4. Estimated fare: 450 KSH × 1.8 = 810 KSH
5. Rider must tap "Accept Surge Pricing" to proceed
6. Rider confirms request with surge pricing
7. Higher earnings attract nearby drivers; driver accepts quickly
8. Trip proceeds normally with surge fare

**Outcome**: Surge balances market; rider gets ride despite high demand; driver earns more

### Scenario 3: Emergency SOS Activation
**Trigger**: Rider feels unsafe during trip (driver off-route, aggressive driving)

**Flow**:
1. Rider taps red SOS button in app (always visible)
2. Safety Agent immediately:
   - Records exact GPS location and timestamp
   - Captures trip data (speed, route, driver info)
   - Sends silent alert to emergency contacts (SMS + app notification)
   - Starts recording audio from rider's device
   - Displays "Help is on the way" message to rider
3. If rider confirms emergency (vs accidental tap):
   - System alerts local police with GPS location
   - System notifies platform safety team (24/7 hotline)
   - System locks driver account pending investigation
4. Safety team calls rider and driver separately
5. Trip ended immediately; no payment charged
6. Investigation initiated with full trip audit trail

**Outcome**: Rider safety prioritized, rapid response, accountability maintained

### Scenario 4: Ride Sharing (RideLink Go Shared)
**Trigger**: Budget-conscious rider opts for shared ride

**Flow**:
1. Rider A requests shared ride: Pickup at Point A, Dropoff at Point D (10 km)
2. Platform Agent searches for compatible rides within 5-minute window
3. Rider B's request found: Pickup at Point B (2 km from A), Dropoff at Point C (8 km)
4. Route Optimizer calculates sequence: A → B → C → D (saves 30% vs separate trips)
5. Driver assigned to shared ride with optimized route
6. Driver picks up Rider A first
7. Driver proceeds to pick up Rider B (Rider A notified: "Picking up another passenger")
8. Driver drops off Rider B at Point C
9. Driver drops off Rider A at Point D
10. Each rider pays reduced fare (Rider A: 315 KSH, Rider B: 280 KSH vs 450 each)

**Outcome**: Both riders save money, driver earns more per trip, reduced traffic/emissions

### Scenario 5: No Drivers Available → Scheduled Ride
**Trigger**: Early morning (5 AM), low driver availability in residential area

**Flow**:
1. Rider requests ride; no drivers within 5 km
2. After 3 broadcast rounds with expanded radius (up to 10 km), still no acceptance
3. Platform Agent suggests: "No drivers available now. Schedule ride for later?"
4. Rider schedules ride for 6:00 AM (1 hour ahead)
5. System confirms scheduled ride
6. At 5:30 AM (30 mins before), system begins matching
7. Driver accepts scheduled ride
8. Rider notified at 5:45 AM with driver details
9. Driver picks up rider on time at 6:00 AM

**Outcome**: Rider gets guaranteed ride despite initial unavailability
