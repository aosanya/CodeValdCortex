# UC-EVENT-001: AI-Powered Event Info Desk - Design Documentation

**Use Case**: CodeValdEvents (Nuruyetu) - AI Info Desk for Live Events  
**Design Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: October 22, 2025

## Overview

This directory contains the software design and architecture documentation for the AI-Powered Event Info Desk use case (UC-EVENT-001). The system demonstrates how live event information services, emergency coordination, and attendee support can be delivered through autonomous agents and AI-powered assistance within the CodeValdCortex framework.

**Note**: *"Nuruyetu" means "Light/Illumination" in Swahili, reflecting the system's role in illuminating information and guiding attendees.*
